# Implementation Roadmap: CSAPI Client Support

**Project:** OGC API – Connected Systems (CSAPI) v1.0 Client Implementation  
**Repository:** OS4CSAPI/ogc-client-CSAPI_2  
**Target:** camptocamp/ogc-client upstream contribution  
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Overview

This roadmap defines the implementation sequence for adding CSAPI support to ogc-client. It will be populated after completing design and testing research.

---

## Prerequisites (Must Complete First)

**Research Phase:**
- [ ] Design strategy research - [design-strategy-research.md](../research/design-strategy-research.md)
  - [ ] PR #114 architecture analysis
  - [ ] Terminology verification (navigator vs other terms)
  - [ ] Code volume analysis
  - [ ] File structure definition
- [ ] Testing strategy research - [testing-strategy-research.md](../research/testing-strategy-research.md)
  - [ ] PR #114 test pattern analysis
  - [ ] Test quality standards definition
  - [ ] Coverage targets per module

**Planning Phase:**
- [ ] FEATURE_SPEC.md Section 3 (Technical Design) - complete after research
- [ ] Architecture diagrams
- [ ] Detailed file structure plan
- [ ] Integration point specifications

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Research & Planning ✅ (Current)

**Goal:** Understand requirements and define approach before writing code

**Status:** In Progress

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ FEATURE_SPEC.md Section 1 (Contribution Vision)
- ✅ FEATURE_SPEC.md Section 2 (Feature Overview)
- ⏳ Design strategy research (in progress)
- ⏳ Testing strategy research (planned)
- ⏳ FEATURE_SPEC.md Section 3 (Technical Design) (planned)

## Dependencies & Blockers

**Current Blockers:**
- Design research must complete before defining implementation phases
- Testing strategy must be understood before writing code
- Terminology question must be resolved
- Code volume analysis must inform design decisions

## Risk Management

_[To be defined after research]_

---

## Timeline Estimates

_[To be defined after research - will be based on findings from PR #114 analysis and lessons from previous iterations]_

---

## Notes

**Why this roadmap is mostly empty:**
- We're doing research FIRST to avoid wasted implementation effort
- Previous iterations showed that jumping to implementation without proper research led to problems
- This roadmap will be populated with concrete phases once we understand upstream patterns

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete design strategy research
2. Complete testing strategy research  
3. Define technical design (FEATURE_SPEC Section 3)
4. Populate this roadmap with specific implementation phases
5. Begin implementation
