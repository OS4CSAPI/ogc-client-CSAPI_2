# Feature Specification: CSAPI Client Support

**Project:** OGC API – Connected Systems (CSAPI) v1.0 Client Implementation  
**Target Repository:** camptocamp/ogc-client  
**Status:** In Development

## 1. Contribution Vision

This contribution adds comprehensive client support for OGC API – Connected Systems (CSAPI) v1.0 to ogc-client, enabling developers to build applications that communicate with CSAPI-compliant servers. The implementation provides standards-based programmatic access to sensor systems, real-time observations, deployments, and dynamic data streams, eliminating the need for developers to manually implement the specification and ensuring their applications achieve interoperability with any CSAPI-compliant endpoint. By extending ogc-client's proven patterns to cover this newly published standard (July 2025), this work fills a critical gap for IoT, sensor web, and observational data applications. The contribution implements both Part 1 (Feature Resources) and Part 2 (Dynamic Data), delivering complete CSAPI client functionality that aligns with upstream conventions and reduces the development burden for standards-compliant sensor data integration.
