# Phase 1 Reconnaissance Report: Section Restoration Plan

**Date:** February 5, 2026  
**Objective:** Restore 18 missing sections from v1 into v6  
**Status:** ✅ Reconnaissance Complete - Ready for Phase 2

---

## Executive Summary

v5 successfully archived as `csapi-implementation-guide-v5.md`. Base for v6 created from v5 (2,934 lines). Comprehensive mapping of all sections from v1 completed. **Discovered: "Query Parameters Reference" never existed in v1 - broken link.** Actually need to restore **17 sections** (not 18).

**Total restoration:** ~894 lines  
**Final v6 size estimate:** ~4,356 lines  
**Result:** Complete, self-contained implementation guide

---

## Key Findings

### Critical Discovery: Query Parameters Section Non-Existent

- **Listed in v1 ToC** (line 49): `[Query Parameters Reference](#complete-query-parameter-support)`
- **BUT:** No actual `#### Complete Query Parameter Support` section exists in v1
- **Status:** Broken link in v1 that propagated to all versions
- **Action:** Skip this section - remove from ToC in Phase 4

### Sections Successfully Mapped: 17 Total

All 17 sections located in v1 with exact line ranges, ready for extraction and insertion.

## Phase Execution Plan

### ✅ Phase 1: Reconnaissance (COMPLETE)
**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Actions:**
- ✅ Archived v5 to `csapi-implementation-guide-v5.md`
- ✅ Created v6 base from v5
- ✅ Mapped all 17 sections from v1
- ✅ Identified exact line ranges
- ✅ Located insertion points
- ✅ Validated line count estimates
- ✅ Discovered Query Parameters section doesn't exist

**Deliverables:**
- Archived v5 (2,934 lines)
- v6 base ready for edits
- This reconnaissance report

---

### Phase 2: Resource Methods Insertion (READY)
**Estimated duration:** 20-30 minutes  
**Actions:**
1. Read lines 435-919 from v1 (9 sections)
2. Insert after line 1197 in v6 (after Navigation Patterns)
3. Verify insertion (should be ~485 lines added)
4. Update 9 ToC links (lines 67-75) - verify anchors match

**Expected result:**
- v6 grows from 2,934 → ~3,419 lines
- 9 resource method sections restored
- All resource method ToC links functional

**Checkpoint:** Verify all 9 section headers match ToC anchor format exactly

---

### Phase 3: Format Handlers & Infrastructure (PENDING)
**Estimated duration:** 15-20 minutes  
**Actions:**
1. Read lines 960-1368 from v1 (8 sections)
2. Remove placeholder note at line ~2580 (shifted from 2095)
3. Insert 8 sections at removal point
4. Verify insertion (should be ~409 lines added)
5. Update 8 ToC links (lines 80-84, 86, 88, 90)

**Expected result:**
- v6 grows from ~3,419 → ~3,828 lines
- All format handler and infrastructure sections restored
- All ToC links functional

**Checkpoint:** Verify placeholder removed and all 8 sections inserted cleanly

---

### Phase 4: Cleanup & Version Update (PENDING)
**Estimated duration:** 10 minutes  
**Actions:**
1. Update version header: `Version: 5.0` → `Version: 6.0 (Complete Self-Contained Guide)`
2. Update last updated date to February 5, 2026
3. Remove broken "Query Parameters Reference" from ToC (line 76)
4. Update footer with v5 archive link
5. Add version history note explaining restoration
6. Spot-check 5-6 random ToC links
7. Commit with comprehensive message
8. Push to remote

**Expected result:**
- v6 finalized at ~4,356 lines
- All 17 sections restored
- Version history updated
- Complete, self-contained guide

**Final deliverable:** csapi-implementation-guide.md v6.0 (complete)

## Rationale for Full Restoration (Option 3)

### Why Not Option 1 (Document Reference Pattern)?
- ❌ Requires users to consult archive
- ❌ Not self-contained
- ❌ Poor developer experience

### Why Not Option 3-Lite (Resource Methods Only)?
- ❌ Still missing format handler details
- ❌ Incomplete reference for developers
- ❌ Partial solution creates confusion

### Why Not Option 4 (Separate API Reference)?
- ❌ Two documents to maintain
- ❌ User rejected this option explicitly
- ❌ Splits natural flow of information

### ✅ Why Full Restoration (Option 3)?
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Self-contained for all use cases
- ✅ Complete developer reference
- ✅ No archive dependencies
- ✅ Professional, comprehensive guide
- ✅ User's explicit preference

## Risk Assessment

### Risks Identified

**1. Token Exhaustion (MITIGATED)**
- **Risk:** Multiple large reads/writes could exceed limits
- **Mitigation:** Phased approach with checkpoints
- **Status:** LOW - Phases 2-3 are manageable chunks

**2. Insertion Errors (MITIGATED)**
- **Risk:** Wrong insertion point breaks document structure
- **Mitigation:** Exact line numbers identified with context
- **Status:** LOW - Clear markers identified

**3. ToC Mismatch (ADDRESSED)**
- **Risk:** Section headers don't match ToC anchor links
- **Mitigation:** Headers from v1 will match v6 ToC (both auto-generated)
- **Status:** LOW - GitHub auto-generates consistent anchors

**4. Context Loss (MITIGATED)**
- **Risk:** Interruption during multi-phase work
- **Mitigation:** This report documents all details
- **Status:** LOW - Can resume from any phase
