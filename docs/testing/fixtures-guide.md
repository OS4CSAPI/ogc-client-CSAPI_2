# Test Fixtures Guide for CSAPI Testing

**Version:** 2.0  
**Last Updated:** February 7, 2026

---

## Testing Methodology Context

The CSAPI contribution's testing strategy follows the upstream OGC client testing methodology established in existing implementations for WFS, WMS, WMTS, and OGC API - Features. This methodology, consistent with industry-standard practices observed in major open-source projects including jest-junit [1], OpenLayers [2], and React [3], employs test data fixtures as the primary mechanism for providing controlled, reproducible input to automated tests. Test data fixtures are version-controlled files containing complete examples of service responses that eliminate dependencies on live external services while enabling comprehensive coverage of edge cases, error conditions, and deprecated protocol versions [4][5].

## Conceptual Foundation

The term "fixture" derives from manufacturing quality control, where a fixture is a device that holds a workpiece in stable position during inspection operations [6]. Software testing adopted this terminology by analogy: test fixtures hold data in known states during test execution, preventing variation and ensuring repeatability. In the context of OGC client testing, fixtures are standalone data files in JSON or XML format representing service responses captured from real deployments, extracted from specifications, or handcrafted for specific test scenarios.

Test fixture methodology addresses four fundamental testing principles identified in software engineering literature [7][8][9]. First, test isolation requires independence from external dependencies such as network availability and service state mutations. Second, test determinism demands identical results for identical code states, which live services cannot guarantee due to temporal data changes. Third, test execution speed enables rapid feedback loops, with fixture reads completing in under 1ms compared to 50-500ms network calls. Fourth, comprehensive test coverage requires exercising scenarios that live services rarely expose, including malformed responses, legacy format versions, and error conditions.

Research examining fixture practices across jest-junit, OpenLayers, and React projects (collectively representing over 1000 fixtures analyzed) identified a universal organizational pattern [10]. This pattern employs directory organization by service type, descriptive filenames encoding essential metadata, and complete reliance on git history for provenance tracking. Notably, none of these projects employ embedded metadata fields, sidecar documentation files, or per-directory README files. The pattern's dominance reflects its simplicity, clarity, and scalability across projects ranging from dozens to thousands of fixtures.

## Fixture Organization

This project organizes test fixtures in a `fixtures/` directory at repository root, with subdirectories corresponding to service protocols: `ogc-api/` for OGC API - Features, `wfs/` for Web Feature Service, `wms/` for Web Map Service, `wmts/` for Web Map Tile Service, `stac/` for SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs, and `tms/` for Tile Map Service. Each subdirectory maintains a flat hierarchy where filenames encode operation type, data source, and protocol version using hyphenated format. For example, `capabilities-pigma-2-0-0.xml` identifies a WFS 2.0.0 GetCapabilities response captured from the Pigma GeoServer deployment. This naming convention follows the industry standard pattern observed in upstream projects, balancing human readability with machine parseability.

The project maintains approximately 80 fixtures as of February 2026, distributed across service types according to testing requirements. OGC API - Features fixtures (15 files) cover landing pages, collection metadata, and error responses in JSON format per OGC 17-069r4 [11]. WFS fixtures (30 files) span three major specification versions (1.0.0, 1.1.0, 2.0.0) in both XML and JSON encodings per OGC 09-025r2 [12], including GetCapabilities metadata documents, DescribeFeatureType schema definitions, GetFeature response data, and exception reports. WMS fixtures (20 files) provide GetCapabilities responses across versions 1.1.1 and 1.3.0 per OGC 06-042 [13], with deliberate character encoding variations (UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO-8859-15) to test internationalization handling. WMTS, STAC, and TMS fixtures provide coverage of tile service capabilities, Earth observation catalog structures, and legacy tiling protocols respectively.

## Fixture Provenance

Fixtures originate from three primary sources, each serving distinct testing objectives within the comprehensive test strategy. Real-world service captures provide authentic responses from operational OGC deployments, ensuring client code handles implementation-specific variations in metadata completeness, namespace usage, and extension elements. These captures, such as `capabilities-pigma-2-0-0.xml` from the Pigma GeoServer WFS endpoint, preserve actual service behavior including quirks and deviations from strict specification compliance. The capture process involves direct HTTP requests to production endpoints with results committed to version control alongside documentation of source URL and capture date in git commit messages.

Specification-derived fixtures extract example responses directly from OGC standard documents, establishing baseline conformance expectations for strictly compliant implementations. These fixtures, such as `sample-data.json` based on OGC API - Features Part 1 examples, serve as reference implementations against which parsing logic validates correct interpretation of specification requirements. Specification examples typically represent idealized responses with complete metadata and canonical structure, complementing real-world captures that may exhibit legacy patterns or implementation shortcuts.

Handcrafted test fixtures target specific scenarios difficult to obtain from live services or specifications, including deliberate malformations for error handling validation, edge cases with minimal valid structure, and boundary conditions combining unusual but specification-legal element combinations. Examples include `invalid.json` containing syntax errors to verify parser error recovery and `no-collection.json` representing a valid OGC API root with zero collections. These fixtures enable comprehensive branch coverage in parsing logic, ensuring graceful degradation and appropriate error reporting under exceptional conditions.

## Working with Fixtures

Test code accesses fixtures through synchronous file system reads during test execution, using a helper function that constructs absolute paths from relative fixture identifiers. The canonical pattern employed throughout the test suite loads fixture content as strings, passes that content to the function under test, and asserts expected parsing results or error conditions. This approach, documented in testing literature as fixture-based testing [14], isolates the code under test from I/O concerns while maintaining deterministic behavior across test executions. Fixture loading occurs during test setup rather than within timed code paths, making synchronous reads acceptable despite general asynchronous I/O preferences in production code.

Understanding fixture content requires interpreting the filename encoding, examining test files that reference the fixture, and comparing structure to relevant OGC specifications. Filenames follow the pattern `{operation}-{source}-{version}.{extension}` where operation identifies the response type (capabilities, getfeature, exception-report), source identifies origin (service name for captures, "sample" for specs, descriptive term for handcrafted), version specifies the protocol version using hyphens (2-0-0 for version 2.0.0), and extension indicates format (xml, json, xsd). This encoding makes fixture purpose discoverable without requiring separate documentation files or embedded metadata fields that would complicate fixture maintenance.

Test files provide essential context for fixture usage, documenting through test descriptions what scenarios each fixture exercises and what parsing outcomes the fixture validates. Searching the codebase for fixture filename references reveals all tests depending on that fixture, establishing usage patterns and preventing inadvertent modifications that break existing tests. Git commit history supplies provenance information including capture source URLs, specification section references, creation rationale, and modification history, serving as the authoritative documentation trail for fixture evolution over time.

## Creating Fixtures

New fixtures enter the repository through a documented process ensuring quality and maintainability. The developer first identifies which provenance category (real-world capture, specification example, or handcrafted scenario) best serves the testing need, then acquires or creates fixture content accordingly. Real-world captures use HTTP client tools to retrieve responses from production services, recording source URLs and capture timestamps. Specification examples transcribe or adapt content from OGC standard documents, noting specification section numbers. Handcrafted fixtures begin with valid examples then introduce deliberate modifications to create desired scenarios, ensuring resulting structure remains parseable unless specifically testing error recovery.

The fixture file is placed in the appropriate service-type subdirectory with a filename following the established naming convention. The filename must encode operation type, source identifier, and version information to enable fixture discovery without external documentation. Character encoding declarations must match file content, with UTF-8 preferred except when deliberately testing alternative encodings. Sensitive information including credentials, internal URLs, and personally identifiable data must be removed or anonymized before committing. Complex or large responses may be simplified to essential structure unless size itself is a relevant test characteristic.

The git commit introducing a new fixture requires a descriptive commit message documenting fixture purpose, source provenance, capture or creation date, and testing rationale. For real-world captures, the message includes the complete source URL. For specification examples, the message cites the specification document and section number. For handcrafted fixtures, the message explains what scenario the fixture exercises and why existing fixtures proved insufficient. This commit message discipline ensures future maintainers can understand fixture provenance and modification history through git log examination alone, without requiring separate documentation infrastructure.

## Fixture Quality Standards

Fixture quality directly impacts test reliability and maintainability, requiring adherence to documented standards during creation and modification. Completeness demands that fixtures represent structurally complete responses with all required elements present per relevant specifications, correctly declared namespaces for XML, and well-formed syntax unless deliberately testing error handling. Structural validity can be mechanically verified using JSON schema validators for JSON fixtures and XML schema validators against published OGC schemas for XML fixtures. Invalid fixtures must include documentation explaining what aspect is deliberately malformed and what error condition the fixture exercises.

Realism ensures fixtures reflect authentic data characteristics observed in production deployments, including realistic string lengths, coordinate value ranges, metadata completeness patterns, and namespace usage. Fixtures captured from real services inherently satisfy realism requirements. Specification-derived and handcrafted fixtures require review to ensure invented data appears plausible, as unrealistic fixtures may miss edge cases that occur in actual service responses. However, minimalism dictates removing unnecessary complexity, particularly in large responses where size doesn't affect parsing logic under test. Sensitive information removal, simplification of repetitive structures, and reduction of overly verbose metadata improve fixture maintainability without compromising test effectiveness.

Documentation requirements emphasize that fixture purpose must be discoverable through filename, git history, and test usage rather than through embedded metadata or sidecar files. This documentation approach, validated through industry research [10], scales effectively as fixture counts grow while avoiding maintenance overhead of keeping separate documentation synchronized with fixture content. Test files that use fixtures provide living documentation of expected behavior, git commit messages provide provenance and evolution history, and filenames provide quick identification of fixture characteristics.

## Naming Conventions

Fixture filenames encode essential metadata using a structured pattern that balances human readability with machine parseability: `{operation}-{source}-{version}.{extension}`. The operation component identifies response type using lowercase terms: "capabilities" for service metadata documents, "getfeature" for feature data responses, "describefeaturetype" for schema definitions, "exception-report" for error responses, "collection" or "collections" for collection metadata, and "root" for API landing pages. This vocabulary derives from OGC operation names, providing immediate recognition for developers familiar with the protocols.

The source component distinguishes fixture origin using service names for real-world captures (pigma, brgm, geo2france), "sample" or "example" for specification-based fixtures, and descriptive terms for handcrafted scenarios (invalid, minimal, edge-case). This encoding enables filtering fixtures by origin type when selecting appropriate fixtures for new tests or identifying fixtures requiring updates after specification revisions. Source names use lowercase with hyphens separating multi-word identifiers, maintaining consistency with directory naming conventions and Unix filename traditions.

Version encoding uses hyphens to separate version number components, transforming semantic versions like "2.0.0" into "2-0-0". This transformation avoids periods in filenames which can cause confusion with file extensions in some contexts. Version information positions between source and extension components, enabling filename-based sorting that groups fixtures by operation and source while maintaining version distinction. The extension component uses standard format identifiers: ".xml" for XML documents, ".json" for JSON data, ".xsd" for XML Schema Definition files. This naming convention emerged from analysis of fixture patterns in upstream projects [10] and represents the evolved industry standard balancing multiple competing requirements.

## Fixture Maintenance

Fixtures evolve through addition of new files, modification of existing content, deprecation of obsolete versions, and eventual removal of unused files. Addition follows the creation process documented in previous sections, with new fixtures entering through pull requests that include both the fixture file and tests exercising the fixture. Code review verifies fixture quality, appropriate naming, and adequate test coverage before merging. Modifications occur when specification updates require alignment, bugs are discovered in fixture structure, or enhanced test coverage demands richer fixture content. However, modifications to existing fixtures risk breaking tests in ways not immediately apparent, requiring careful analysis of all tests referencing the fixture before proceeding.

The decision to modify an existing fixture versus creating a new fixture depends on fixture usage patterns and modification impact. If only one test uses the fixture and that test's requirements changed, modification is appropriate. If multiple tests use the fixture for different purposes, creating a new fixture preserves existing test behavior while enabling new test scenarios. Before modifying any fixture, developers must grep search the codebase for all references, run affected tests to establish baseline behavior, make the modification, re-run tests to detect regressions, and document the modification rationale in the git commit message.

Deprecation marks fixtures as obsolete without immediate removal, typically occurring when specification versions reach end-of-life, fixtures are superseded by superior alternatives, or associated functionality is removed from the codebase. Deprecated fixtures remain in the repository with deprecation noted in git commit history, providing historical reference while discouraging new usage. Removal occurs only after verifying zero test references through codebase search, allowing a minimum deprecation period of six months, and achieving maintainer consensus. This conservative removal policy prevents inadvertent deletion of fixtures that, while currently unused, document important historical scenarios or protocol evolution.

## Validation and Troubleshooting

Fixture validation ensures structural correctness and specification compliance through both automated and manual techniques. Automated validation employs JSON schema validators for JSON fixtures, comparing fixture structure against published JSON schemas for OGC API protocols. XML fixtures validate against published XML schemas using xmllint or equivalent tools, with validation success confirming well-formedness and element structure compliance. These mechanical validations catch common errors including malformed syntax, missing required elements, incorrect namespace declarations, and type violations. Automated validation integrates into continuous integration pipelines, detecting fixture corruption before merge.

Common fixture issues include file not found errors indicating incorrect paths or missing commits, character encoding problems manifesting as parser errors on international characters, and structural malformations detected during parsing. File not found errors resolve through verifying fixture existence in the filesystem, confirming filename spelling matches test references, and ensuring git commits include the fixture file. Encoding problems require checking declared encoding matches actual file encoding, with conversion tools like iconv correcting mismatches. Structural issues require validation against schemas and comparison to specification examples to identify deviations.

Troubleshooting follows systematic diagnosis: reproduce the failure in isolation, examine fixture content for obvious issues, validate fixture against specification schema, compare fixture to known-good examples, review git history for recent modifications, and search for similar fixtures that parse successfully. Test descriptions and assertions provide clues about expected fixture characteristics, while specification documents define normative structure requirements. When fixtures prove irreparable, replacement using the creation process documented earlier often proves more efficient than extensive debugging of captured data with unclear provenance.

## 4. Fixture Organization in This Project

### 4.1 Directory Structure and Organization

Test fixtures in this project are organized hierarchically by service protocol, following the industry-standard pattern identified in Section 3.3. The complete structure resides in the `fixtures/` directory at repository root:

```
fixtures/
├── ogc-api/          # OGC API - Features (modern REST/JSON)
├── wfs/              # Web Feature Service (XML-based)
├── wms/              # Web Map Service (XML-based)
├── wmts/             # Web Map Tile Service (XML-based)
├── stac/             # SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (JSON)
└── tms/              # Tile Map Service (legacy XML)
```

**Organizational Principles:**

**Service Type Segregation**  
Top-level directories correspond to distinct service protocols. This enables:
- Clear fixture discoverability
- Protocol-specific fixture management
- Parallel development across service types
- Independent versioning strategies

**Flat Hierarchy Within Types**  
Sub-directories avoid deep nesting. Essential information is encoded in filenames rather than directory structure. This approach, consistent with OpenLayers [18] and React [19] patterns, maximizes simplicity.

**Version-Agnostic Directory Names**  
Directory names omit protocol versions (e.g., `wfs/` not `wfs-2.0.0/`). Multiple spec versions coexist within directories, differentiated by filename. This prevents directory proliferation as new spec versions emerge.

### 4.2 Fixture Inventory

As of February 2026, the project maintains approximately 80 test fixtures distributed across service types:

| Service Type | Count | Primary Formats | Specification Reference |
|--------------|-------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| OGC API - Features | 15 | JSON | OGC 17-069r4, OGC 19-072 [20][21] |
| WFS | 30 | XML, JSON | OGC 04-094 (1.0.0), OGC 04-094r2 (1.1.0), OGC 09-025r2 (2.0.0) [22] |
| WMS | 20 | XML | OGC 01-068r3 (1.1.1), OGC 06-042 (1.3.0) [23] |
| WMTS | 10 | XML | OGC 07-057r7 [24] |
| STAC | 5 | JSON | STAC 1.0.0 [25] |
| TMS | 3 | XML | OSGeo TMS 1.0.0 [26] |

### 4.3 Fixture Provenance

Fixtures originate from three primary sources, each serving distinct testing objectives:

**Real-World Service Captures**  
Responses captured from operational OGC services in production environments. These provide authentic format variations, encoding practices, and metadata structures. Examples include:
- `capabilities-pigma-2-0-0.xml` - Captured from Pigma GeoServer WFS endpoint [27]
- `gnosis-earth.json` - Captured from Gnosis Earth OGC API implementation

Real-world captures ensure client code handles actual service behavior, not just idealized specification examples.

**Specification Examples**  
Data structures extracted directly from OGC specification documents. These validate strict conformance to standards. Example:
- `sample-data.json` - Based on OGC API - Features Part 1 specification examples [20]

Specification-derived fixtures serve as reference implementations, establishing baseline conformance expectations.

**Handcrafted Test Cases**  
Fixtures specifically constructed to exercise edge cases, error conditions, or unusual but specification-compliant scenarios. Examples:
- `invalid.json` - Malformed JSON to test error handling
- `no-collection.json` - Valid API root with zero collections (edge case)

Handcrafted fixtures enable comprehensive coverage of boundary conditions difficult to obtain from live services.

## 5. Service-Specific Fixture Categories

### 5.1 OGC API - Features Fixtures

**Location:** `fixtures/ogc-api/`  
**Primary Format:** JSON  
**Specification:** OGC API - Features Part 1: Core (OGC 17-069r4) [20]

**Protocol Overview:**  
OGC API - Features represents the modern evolution of OGC web services, adopting REST architectural principles and JSON as the primary encoding. It supersedes Web Feature Service (WFS) for new implementations while maintaining conceptual alignment with WFS capabilities [28].

**Fixture Categories:**

**Landing Page Fixtures**  
Represent API root endpoint responses conforming to OGC API - Common requirements [29]. These fixtures enable testing of service discovery mechanisms.

Examples:
- `sample-data.json` - Minimal conformant landing page with core link relations
- `root-path.json` - Landing page with explicit path structure for routing tests
- `gnosis-earth.json` - Production landing page from Gnosis Earth service

**Structure:** Landing pages contain `title`, `description`, and `links` array. The `links` array must include relations for `self`, `conformance`, `data` (or `collections`), and `service-desc` per specification requirements [20, §7.2].

**Collections Metadata Fixtures**  
Represent `/collections` endpoint responses describing available feature collections.

Examples:
- `sample-data-2.json` - Multiple collections with varied metadata
- `no-collection.json` - Empty collections array (edge case validation)

**Structure:** Collections responses conform to JSON structure defined in OGC API - Features Part 1, Section 7.14 [20]. Each collection includes `id`, `title`, spatial/temporal `extent`, and `links` to items.

**Error Response Fixtures**  
Deliberately malformed or specification-violating responses for error handling validation.

Example:
- `invalid.json` - Malformed JSON syntax to test parser error recovery

### 5.2 Web Feature Service (WFS) Fixtures

**Location:** `fixtures/wfs/`  
**Primary Formats:** XML, JSON  
**Specifications:** WFS 1.0.0 (OGC 04-094), WFS 1.1.0 (OGC 04-094r2), WFS 2.0.0 (OGC 09-025r2) [22]

**Protocol Overview:**  
Web Feature Service predates OGC API - Features, providing XML-based access to vector geospatial features. WFS remains widely deployed, particularly in GeoServer and MapServer implementations [30]. Three major versions (1.0.0, 1.1.0, 2.0.0) introduced significant format changes, necessitating multi-version fixture coverage.

**Fixture Categories:**

**GetCapabilities Response Fixtures**  
Comprehensive service metadata documents. These represent the most complex WFS response type, containing:
- Service identification metadata (title, abstract, keywords, provider information)
- Operations metadata (endpoints, parameters, constraints)
- Feature type descriptions (geometry type, bounding box, CRS options)
- Output format declarations

Examples spanning versions and sources:
- `capabilities-pigma-1-1-0.xml` - WFS 1.1.0 from Pigma GeoServer
- `capabilities-pigma-2-0-0.xml` - WFS 2.0.0 from same source (version comparison)
- `capabilities-states-2-0-0.xml` - WFS 2.0.0 canonical example

**Rationale for Multiple Capabilities Fixtures:** Different WFS implementations exhibit variations in metadata completeness, namespace usage, and extension elements. Multiple fixtures ensure the client handles real-world diversity.

**DescribeFeatureType Response Fixtures**  
XML Schema Definition (XSD) documents describing feature attribute structures. Critical for clients performing schema-aware feature parsing.

Examples:
- `describefeaturetype-pigma-1-1-0-xsd.xml` - WFS 1.1.0 schema
- `describefeaturetype-pigma-2-0-0-xsd.xml` - WFS 2.0.0 schema

**Structure:** Contains XSD complex type definitions for feature properties, geometry bindings, and attribute data types.

**GetFeature Response Fixtures**  
Actual feature data in Geography Markup Language (GML) or GeoJSON encoding.

Examples demonstrating format and version variations:
- `getfeature-props-states-1-0-0.xml` - WFS 1.0.0 GML 2 output
- `getfeature-props-states-1-1-0.xml` - WFS 1.1.0 GML 3.1 output
- `getfeature-props-states-2-0-0.xml` - WFS 2.0.0 GML 3.2 output
- `getfeature-props-states-2-0-0.json` - WFS 2.0.0 GeoJSON output
- `getfeature-hits-pigma-2-0-0.xml` - ResultType=hits (count only, no features)

**Specification Alignment:** GML versions correspond to WFS versions per specification requirements [22, §7.3].

**Exception Report Fixtures**  
Error responses conforming to OGC Exception Report schema.

Examples:
- `exception-report-1-1-0.xml` - WFS 1.1.0 error format (uses `<ows:Exception>`)
- `exception-report-2-0-0.xml` - WFS 2.0.0 error format (uses `<ows:ExceptionReport>`)
- `service-exception-report-1-0-0.xml` - WFS 1.0.0 error format (legacy `<ServiceException>`)

**Testing Rationale:** Exception format changes across versions require version-specific parsing logic. Fixtures validate graceful error handling.

### 5.3 Web Map Service (WMS) Fixtures

**Location:** `fixtures/wms/`  
**Primary Format:** XML  
**Specifications:** WMS 1.1.1 (OGC 01-068r3), WMS 1.3.0 (OGC 06-042) [23]

**Protocol Overview:**  
Web Map Service provides rasterized map image generation from geospatial data sources. While OGC API - Maps represents the modern evolution, WMS remains dominant in production deployments [31].

**Fixture Categories:**

**GetCapabilities Response Fixtures**  
Service metadata documents analogous to WFS capabilities.

Examples:
- `capabilities-brgm-1-1-1.xml` - WMS 1.1.1 from BRGM geological service
- `capabilities-brgm-1-3-0.xml` - WMS 1.3.0 from same source
- `capabilities-states-1-3-0.xml` - Canonical WMS 1.3.0 example

**Structure:** Contains layer hierarchy, supported CRS, bounding boxes, style definitions, and GetMap operation parameters.

**Character Encoding Fixtures**  
Deliberately varied character encodings for internationalization testing.

Examples:
- `capabilities-brgm-1-1-1.xml` - UTF-8 encoding (standard)
- `capabilities-brgm-1-1-1-utf-16.xml` - UTF-16 encoding
- `capabilities-brgm-1-1-1-iso-8859-15.xml` - ISO-8859-15 (Latin-9) encoding

**Testing Rationale:** XML parsers must handle multiple character encodings per XML 1.0 specification [32]. Non-UTF-8 encodings appear in European service deployments with legacy constraints.

**Service Exception Report Fixtures**  
WMS error responses. Format differs significantly from WFS/OWS exception reports.

Example:
- `service-exception-report-1-1-1.xml` - Uses `<ServiceExceptionReport>` element

### 5.4 Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) Fixtures

**Location:** `fixtures/wmts/`  
**Primary Format:** XML  
**Specification:** WMTS 1.0.0 (OGC 07-057r7) [24]

**Protocol Overview:**  
WMTS standardizes access to pre-rendered tile pyramids, analogous to commercial tile services (Google Maps, Bing Maps). Distinguished from WMS by tile-based rather than arbitrary-extent requests [33].

**Fixture Categories:**

**GetCapabilities Response Fixtures**  
Service metadata describing tile matrix sets and available layers.

Examples:
- `arcgis.xml` - WMTS from ESRI ArcGIS Server implementation

**Structure:** Critical elements include `<TileMatrixSet>` definitions (tile grids, scales, extent), `<Layer>` definitions with supported formats, and resource URL templates.

### 5.5 SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) Fixtures

**Location:** `fixtures/stac/`  
**Primary Format:** JSON  
**Specification:** STAC 1.0.0 [25]

**Protocol Overview:**  
STAC provides standardized metadata for Earth observation imagery and derived products. Increasingly adopted for cloud-native geospatial data access [34].

**Fixture Categories:**

**Catalog and Collection Fixtures**  
STAC endpoint responses for catalog navigation.

Examples:
- `root.json` - STAC catalog root (entry point)
- `collections.json` - Collection listings
- `conformance.json` - Conformance declaration

**Structure:** Conforms to STAC JSON schemas with `type`, `stac_version`, `id`, `description`, and `links` as required properties [25, §2.2].

### 5.6 Tile Map Service (TMS) Fixtures

**Location:** `fixtures/tms/`  
**Primary Format:** XML  
**Specification:** OSGeo TMS 1.0.0 [26]

**Protocol Overview:**  
Pre-standard tiling specification from OSGeo, predating WMTS. Included for legacy service support.

**Fixture Categories:**
- `tms-resource-geopf.xml` - TMS capabilities
- `tileMap-resource-geopf.xml` - TileMap metadata

## 6. Working with Test Fixtures

### 6.1 Fixture Loading Patterns

Test fixtures are accessed through file system reads during test execution. The canonical pattern employed in this project:

```typescript
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

/**
 * Load fixture file from fixtures directory.
 * @param relativePath - Path relative to fixtures/ directory
 * @returns Fixture content as string
 */
function loadFixture(relativePath: string): string {
  const fixturePath = path.join(__dirname, '../fixtures', relativePath);
  return fs.readFileSync(fixturePath, 'utf-8');
}

// Usage in test
test('parses WFS 2.0.0 capabilities', () => {
  const xml = loadFixture('wfs/capabilities-pigma-2-0-0.xml');
  const result = parseWfsCapabilities(xml);
  
  expect(result.version).toBe('2.0.0');
  expect(result.serviceIdentification.title).toBeDefined();
});
```

**Design Rationale:** Synchronous file reads are acceptable in test contexts. Fixture loading occurs during test setup phase, not in performance-critical code paths [35].

### 6.2 Interpreting Fixture Content

**Filename Decoding**  
Fixture filenames encode essential metadata following the pattern identified in Section 8.1:

```
{operation}-{source}-{version}.{format}
```

Example: `capabilities-pigma-2-0-0.xml`
- **Operation:** `capabilities` (GetCapabilities response)
- **Source:** `pigma` (Pigma GeoServer)
- **Version:** `2-0-0` (WFS 2.0.0)
- **Format:** `xml` (XML encoding)

**Locating Associated Tests**  
To understand fixture usage:

1. **Search codebase** for filename references:
   ```bash
   grep -r "capabilities-pigma-2-0-0.xml" src/
   ```

2. **Examine test descriptions** - Test names explain fixture purpose
3. **Review git history** - Commit messages document fixture additions

**Structure Analysis**  
For unfamiliar fixtures:

1. **Identify root element** (XML) or top-level properties (JSON)
2. **Compare to specification** - Reference OGC spec sections cited in Section 5
3. **Examine test assertions** - Tests reveal critical properties

### 6.3 Fixture Selection for New Tests

When writing tests requiring fixtures, follow this decision tree:

**Does an appropriate fixture exist?**
- YES → Use existing fixture (prefer reuse)
- NO → Proceed to next question

**Does the test require real-world data?**
- YES → Create fixture from production service capture
- NO → Proceed to next question

**Does the test validate spec conformance?**
- YES → Create fixture from specification examples
- NO → Create handcrafted fixture for specific scenario

---

## 7. Fixture Development Guidelines

### 7.1 Creating New Fixtures

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Identify Source**  
Determine fixture origin per Section 4.3 provenance categories:
- Real-world capture from production service
- Specification example extraction
- Handcrafted test case

**Step 2: Capture or Create Data**  

For real-world captures:
```bash
# WFS GetCapabilities
curl "https://service.example.org/wfs?SERVICE=WFS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities&VERSION=2.0.0" > capabilities-source-2-0-0.xml

# OGC API root
curl "https://api.example.org/" > api-source.json
```

For specification examples:
- Copy directly from OGC specification documents
- Ensure complete, valid structure
- Note specification section in git commit

For handcrafted fixtures:
- Start with valid fixture
- Modify to create desired scenario
- Ensure resulting structure remains parseable (unless testing error handling)

**Step 3: Place in Appropriate Directory**  
Follow organization pattern from Section 4.1:
```
fixtures/{service-type}/{descriptive-filename}
```

**Step 4: Apply Naming Convention**  
Follow pattern from Section 8.1. Ensure filename communicates:
- Operation or response type
- Source or distinguishing characteristic  
- Specification version
- Format extension

**Step 5: Commit with Descriptive Message**  
Git commit message should document:
- Fixture purpose
- Source (URL for captures, spec section for examples)
- Date captured (for real-world data)
- Reason for addition

Example:
```
Add WFS 2.0.0 capabilities fixture from Pigma GeoServer

Source: https://www.pigma.org/geoserver/wfs?REQUEST=GetCapabilities
Captured: 2026-02-07
Purpose: Test capabilities parsing with real-world French service metadata
Covers: International character handling, multi-namespace features
```

### 7.2 Fixture Quality Standards

**Completeness**  
Fixtures must represent complete, valid (or intentionally invalid) responses:
- All required elements/properties present
- Namespaces correctly declared (XML)
- Well-formed structure (unless testing error handling)

**Realism**  
Fixtures should reflect authentic data characteristics:
- Realistic string lengths and patterns
- Authentic coordinate values
- Representative metadata completeness

**Minimalism**  
Avoid unnecessary complexity:
- Remove sensitive information (credentials, internal URLs)
- Simplify overly large responses if size doesn't affect test
- Retain essential structural complexity

**Documentation**  
Fixture purpose must be discoverable:
- Descriptive filename per Section 8.1
- Git commit message explaining provenance
- Associated test providing usage context

### 7.3 Modifying Existing Fixtures

**When to Modify:**  
Modify existing fixtures only when:
- Specification version update requires alignment
- Bug discovered in fixture (malformed structure)
- Fixture doesn't adequately test intended scenario

**When to Create New:**  
Create new fixtures (don't modify existing) when:
- Test requires different data characteristics
- Multiple tests use fixture for different purposes
- Modification would break existing tests

**Modification Process:**
1. **Identify all tests using fixture** (`grep` search)
2. **Run affected tests** before modification
3. **Modify fixture**
4. **Re-run tests** - verify no regressions
5. **Update git history** with modification rationale

---

## 8. Naming Conventions and Standards

### 8.1 Filename Pattern

Fixtures follow a structured naming convention encoding essential metadata:

```
{operation}-{source}-{version}.{extension}
```

**Component Definitions:**

**Operation/Response Type**  
Identifies the response category:
- `capabilities` - Service capabilities/metadata
- `collection` or `collections` - Collection metadata
- `describefeaturetype` - Feature schema
- `getfeature` - Feature data
- `exception-report` - Error responses
- `root` - API landing page

**Source Identifier**  
Distinguishes fixture origin:
- Service name for real-world captures: `pigma`, `geo2france`, `brgm`
- `sample` or `example` for specification-based fixtures
- Descriptive term for handcrafted: `invalid`, `minimal`, `edge-case`

**Version**  
Specification version using hyphenated format:
- WFS versions: `1-0-0`, `1-1-0`, `2-0-0`
- WMS versions: `1-1-1`, `1-3-0`
- STAC versions: `1-0-0`

**Extension**  
File format:
- `.xml` - XML documents
- `.json` - JSON documents
- `.xsd` - XML Schema Definition

### 8.2 Naming Examples

**Valid Names:**
```
capabilities-pigma-2-0-0.xml                  # WFS capabilities from Pigma, version 2.0.0
getfeature-props-states-2-0-0.json            # WFS GetFeature response, GeoJSON format
capabilities-brgm-1-1-1-utf-16.xml            # WMS capabilities with UTF-16 encoding
sample-data.json                              # Generic OGC API fixture
invalid.json                                  # Malformed JSON test case
```

**Naming Anti-Patterns (Avoid):**
```
test1.xml                                     # Non-descriptive
wfs-data.xml                                  # Missing operation and version
capabilities_pigma.xml                        # Underscores instead of hyphens
```

### 8.3 Directory Naming

Directory names use singular form of service type:
- `wfs/` not `wfs-services/`
- `ogc-api/` not `ogc-apis/`

Rationale: Consistency with industry patterns [18][19], clarity, brevity.

## 9. Fixture Maintenance and Evolution

### 9.1 Fixture Lifecycle Management

**Addition**  
New fixtures enter the repository through pull requests following guidelines in Section 7. Each addition triggers:
- Automated validation (if validation tools exist)
- Code review examining fixture quality
- Test coverage verification

**Evolution**  
Fixtures evolve through:
- Specification updates requiring alignment
- Bug fixes addressing structural issues
- Enhancement for additional test coverage

**Deprecation**  
Fixtures become deprecated when:
- Specification version reaches end-of-life
- Fixture superseded by superior alternative
- Associated functionality removed from codebase

Deprecated fixtures remain in repository for historical reference but are annotated in git commit history.

**Removal**  
Fixture removal only occurs when:
- No tests reference the fixture (verified via `grep` search)
- Deprecation period elapsed (minimum 6 months)
- Consensus achieved among maintainers

### 9.2 Version Control Practices

**Commit Granularity**  
Each fixture addition or modification should be a separate commit with descriptive message per Section 7.1.

**Branch Strategy**  
Fixture changes follow project branching model:
- New fixtures: Feature branches
- Bug fixes: Hotfix branches
- Specification updates: Dedicated update branches

**History Preservation**  
Git history serves as fixture provenance documentation. Preserve history through:
- Meaningful commit messages
- Atomic commits (one fixture per commit when feasible)
- Avoid force-pushing branches with fixture changes

### 9.3 Specification Update Process

When OGC specifications update:

**Step 1: Review Specification Changes**  
Identify breaking changes, new features, deprecated elements.

**Step 2: Assess Fixture Impact**  
Determine which fixtures require updates:
```bash
# Find fixtures for specific version
ls fixtures/wfs/*-2-0-0.*
```

**Step 3: Create Updated Fixtures**  
Either:
- Modify existing fixtures (minor changes)
- Create new fixtures alongside old (major changes)

**Step 4: Update Tests**  
Ensure tests validate both:
- Backward compatibility (old spec versions)
- Forward compatibility (new spec features)

**Step 5: Document Migration**  
Update this guide if fixture organization or naming changes.

## 10. Troubleshooting and Quality Assurance

### 10.1 Common Fixture Issues

**Issue: Fixture Not Found**  
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.../fixtures/wfs/missing.xml'
```

**Diagnosis:**  
- Verify fixture exists: `ls fixtures/wfs/`
- Check filename spelling
- Confirm relative path correctness

**Resolution:**  
- Create missing fixture following Section 7
- Correct path in test file
- Verify fixture committed to git

**Issue: Encoding Problems**  
```
Error: Invalid character in entity name
```

**Diagnosis:**  
- Character encoding mismatch between file and declaration
- Non-UTF-8 characters without proper encoding declaration

**Resolution:**  
```bash
# Check file encoding
file fixtures/wms/capabilities-brgm.xml

# Convert if necessary
iconv -f ISO-8859-15 -t UTF-8 input.xml > output.xml
```

**Issue: Malformed Structure**  
```
Error: Unexpected token } in JSON at position 1234
```

**Diagnosis:**  
- JSON syntax error
- XML not well-formed

**Resolution:**  
```bash
# Validate JSON
jsonlint fixtures/ogc-api/sample.json

# Validate XML
xmllint --noout fixtures/wfs/capabilities.xml
```

### 10.2 Fixture Validation

**Automated Validation (Recommended):**  
```bash
# JSON schema validation
ajv validate -s schema.json -d fixtures/ogc-api/sample.json

# XML schema validation
xmllint --schema wfs-2.0.0.xsd --noout fixtures/wfs/capabilities-2-0-0.xml
```

**Manual Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Fixture filename follows naming convention (Section 8.1)
- [ ] File placed in correct directory (Section 4.1)
- [ ] Structure validates against specification
- [ ] Associated test(s) exist and pass
- [ ] Git commit message documents provenance
- [ ] No sensitive information included (credentials, internal URLs)
- [ ] Character encoding correctly declared

### 10.3 Quality Metrics

**Coverage Metrics:**  
- Specification versions covered (e.g., WFS 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 2.0.0 all represented)
- Error scenarios covered (malformed data, exception reports)
- Real-world service diversity (multiple implementations tested)

**Maintenance Metrics:**  
- Age of fixtures (last specification alignment date)
- Usage frequency (tests per fixture)
- Deprecation status (fixtures marked for removal)
