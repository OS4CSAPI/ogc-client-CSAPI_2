| `ogc-rel:parentSystem` | System (subsystem) | Link to parent system |
| `ogc-rel:samplingFeatures` | System | Link to associated sampling features |
| `ogc-rel:deployments` | System | Link to deployments involving system |
| `ogc-rel:procedures` | System | Link to procedures implemented by system |
| `ogc-rel:featuresOfInterest` | System, Deployment | Link to ultimate features of interest |

  "type": "application/geo+json",
  "title": "Subsystems of sensor"
}
```

**Example Link in SensorML:**
```json

## 8. Resource Relationships Model

### 8.1 System Relationships

**System Associations:**
- **subsystems** → Many Systems (hierarchical, recursive)
- **parentSystem** → One System (inverse of subsystems)
- **systemKind** → One Procedure (system type/datasheet)
- **samplingFeatures** → Many Sampling Features
- **deployments** → Many Deployments
- **procedures** → Many Procedures (can implement multiple)
- **datastreams** → Many DataStreams (Part 2)
- **controlstreams** → Many ControlStreams (Part 2)

**Key Patterns:**
- Subsystems create parent-child hierarchy (can be deeply nested)
- Multiple systems can implement same Procedure (type)
- System can participate in multiple Deployments
- Sampling features always belong to one System

---

### 8.2 Deployment Relationships

**Deployment Associations:**
- **deployedSystems** → Many Systems
- **subdeployments** → Many Deployments (hierarchical)
- **parentDeployment** → One Deployment (inverse)
- **platform** → One Feature (system platform is deployed on)
- **featuresOfInterest** → Many Features
- **samplingFeatures** → Many Sampling Features
- **datastreams** → Many DataStreams (Part 2)
- **controlstreams** → Many ControlStreams (Part 2)

**Key Patterns:**
- Deployments can have temporal and spatial extent
- Multiple systems deployed together in one Deployment
- Subdeployments for hierarchical campaigns

---

### 8.3 Procedure Relationships

**Procedure Associations:**
- **implementingSystems** → Many Systems

**Key Patterns:**
- Procedures describe types, Systems describe instances
- Many Systems can implement same Procedure (many sensors of same model)
- One System can implement multiple Procedures

---

### 8.4 Sampling Feature Relationships

**Sampling Feature Associations:**
- **parentSystem** → One System (required - SF always belongs to system)
- **sampledFeature** → One Feature (ultimate FOI being sampled)
- **sampleOf** → Many Sampling Features (sub-sampling hierarchy)
- **datastreams** → Many DataStreams (Part 2)
- **controlstreams** → Many ControlStreams (Part 2)

**Key Patterns:**
- Sampling Features define system's sampling strategy
- sampledFeature = ultimate FOI (independent real-world feature)
- sampleOf creates sub-sampling hierarchy
- Transitive: if SF-A samples SF-B which samples FOI-C, then SF-A indirectly samples FOI-C

---

### 8.5 Property Relationships

**Property Associations:**
- **baseProperty** → One Property (derivation hierarchy)

**Key Patterns:**
- Properties can be derived from base properties
- Transitive queries: querying for base property includes derived properties
- objectType associates property with specific feature types

---

- Start and end: `["2024-01-01T00:00:00Z", "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"]`
- Open-ended: `["2024-01-01T00:00:00Z", null]` (ongoing)

**System validTime:**
- Specifies validity period of system's description
- Optional for Systems
- When system changes configuration, new version can be created with new validTime

**Deployment validTime:**
- Specifies time period during which systems are deployed
- Required for Deployments
- Temporal extent of deployment

---

### 9.2 Location Updates for Mobile Systems

**Requirement 4:**
- Systems with assetType NOT "Simulation" or "Process" SHOULD have location
- For mobile systems, location property MUST update when system moves
- Server responsible for keeping location current

**Pattern:**
- Client queries `GET {api_root}/systems/{id}` at different times
- Responses show different locations if system moved
- No explicit versioning - current state query pattern

---

### 9.3 Resource History (Not in Part 1)

**Part 1 Scope:**
- Part 1 does NOT define detailed resource history mechanisms
- validTime provides basic temporal validity
- Location updates for mobile systems

**Future/Out of Scope:**
- Complete version history of resource changes
- Audit trail of modifications
- Historical queries (time travel)
- These may be covered in future parts or extensions

---

## 10. Filtering Capabilities Specified

### 10.1 Spatial Filters

**bbox (Bounding Box):**
- Format: `bbox=minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat`
- Applies to: Systems, Deployments, Sampling Features (resources with geometry)
- Matches resources whose geometry intersects bounding box
- Example: `?bbox=-180,-90,180,90`

**geom (Geometry Intersection):**
- Format: WKT geometry
- Applies to: Systems, Deployments, Sampling Features
- Matches resources whose geometry intersects provided geometry
- More flexible than bbox (arbitrary polygons, lines, etc.)
- Example: `?geom=POLYGON((...))`

---

### 10.2 Temporal Filters

**datetime:**
- Format: ISO 8601 datetime or interval
- Applies to: Systems (validTime), Deployments (validTime)
- Single datetime: exact match
- Open-ended interval: `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z/..` (from date forward)
- Closed interval: `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z/2024-12-31T23:59:59Z`
- Matches resources whose validTime overlaps with query interval

---

### 10.3 Identifier Filters

**id (Local ID):**
- Format: Comma-separated list of local IDs
- Applies to: All resource types
- Example: `?id=abc123,def456`

**uid (Unique Identifier):**
- Format: Comma-separated list of URIs
- Applies to: All resource types
- Example: `?uid=urn:uuid:31f6865e-f438-430e-9b57-f965a21ee255,urn:uuid:another-uuid`

---

### 10.4 Text Search Filter

**q (Keyword Search):**
- Format: Text string
- Applies to: All resource types
- Searches across resource properties (implementation-dependent which properties)
- Example: `?q=weather%20station`

---

### 10.5 Property Value Filters

**Custom Property Filters:**
- Format: `{propertyName}={value}`
- Applies to: All resource types
- Filters on specific property values
- Example: `?name=Weather%20Station`
- Example: `?featureType=om:Specimen`

---

### 10.6 Relationship Filters

**parent:**
- Applies to: Systems (subsystems), Deployments (subdeployments)
- Finds resources with specific parent(s)

**procedure:**
- Applies to: Systems
- Finds systems implementing specific procedure(s)

**foi (Feature of Interest):**
- Applies to: Systems, Deployments, Sampling Features
- Finds resources associated with specific FOI(s)
- Transitive for sampling features

**observedProperty:**
- Applies to: Systems, Deployments, Procedures, Sampling Features
- Finds resources associated with specific observed property/properties

**controlledProperty:**
- Applies to: Systems, Deployments, Procedures, Sampling Features
- Finds resources associated with specific controlled property/properties

**system:**
- Applies to: Deployments
- Finds deployments where specific system(s) deployed

**baseProperty:**
- Applies to: Properties
- Finds properties derived from specific base property/properties
- Transitive

**objectType:**
- Applies to: Properties
- Finds properties for specific object/feature type(s)

---

### 10.7 Hierarchical Filters

**recursive:**
- Applies to: Systems (subsystems), Deployments (subdeployments)
- Boolean: true = include all descendants, false/omitted = direct children only
- When true, other filters apply to ALL resources in hierarchy

---

### 10.8 Pagination

**limit:**
- Maximum number of results to return
- Example: `?limit=10`

**offset:**
- Skip first N results
- Example: `?offset=20`
- Combined: `?limit=10&offset=20` returns items 21-30

---

### 10.9 Filter Combination Rules

**Logical AND:**
- Multiple different parameters combined with AND
- Example: `?bbox=-180,-90,180,90&datetime=2024-01-01/..&limit=10`
- Resource must satisfy ALL conditions

**Logical OR:**
- Multiple values in same parameter (ID_List) combined with OR
- Example: `?id=abc,def,ghi` matches id=abc OR id=def OR id=ghi

**Transitive/Recursive:**
- Some filters search transitively (baseProperty, foi via sampledFeature)
- `recursive=true` makes hierarchy traversal recursive
- Documented in standard which filters support transitive behavior

---

### 10.10 Indirect Associations (Recommendation 4)

**Transitive baseProperty:**
- Querying systems by observedProperty=derivedProp SHOULD also match systems observing baseProperty
- Transitive through derivation chain

**Transitive sampledFeature:**
- Querying sampling features by foi=ultimateFOI SHOULD match features sampling intermediate features
- Transitive through sampleOf chain
- Querying systems by foi SHOULD follow sampledFeature transitively

**Recommendation (not requirement):**
- Standard recommends but doesn't require transitive queries
- Implementation-dependent

---

## 11. Requirements Classes and Their Obligations

### 11.1 Minimum Implementation

**No Core Class:**
- Standard explicitly states there is NO core requirements class
- Minimum: Implement at least ONE resource type + ONE encoding

**Typical Minimum:**
- Common conformance class (`/conf/api-common`) - always required
- One resource class (e.g., Systems `/conf/system`)
- One encoding (e.g., GeoJSON `/conf/geojson`)

**Example Minimal Implementation:**
```
/conf/api-common (Common)
/conf/system (System Features)
/conf/geojson (GeoJSON Format)
```

This minimal server exposes Systems in GeoJSON format with basic read operations.

---

### 11.2 Full Part 1 Implementation

**Full Implementation Server:**
- Supports all 5 Part 1 resource types
- Supports both hierarchies (subsystems, subdeployments)
- Supports all CRUD operations
- Supports all 30+ query parameters
- Supports both GeoJSON and SensorML formats

---

### 11.3 Conformance Detection

**Conformance Endpoint:**
- `GET {api_root}/conformance`
- Returns list of conformance class URIs implemented by server

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "conformsTo": [
    "http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-common-1/1.0/conf/core",
    "http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/conf/core",
    "http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-connectedsystems-1/1.0/conf/api-common",
    "http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-connectedsystems-1/1.0/conf/system",
    "http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-connectedsystems-1/1.0/conf/subsystem",

    "http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-connectedsystems-1/1.0/conf/geojson"
  ]
}
```

**Client Usage:**
- Client queries conformance endpoint to discover server capabilities

## Summary

This analysis of CSAPI Part 1 standard document reveals:

**5 Resource Types:**
- Systems (observing systems, sensors, actuators, platforms)
- Deployments (system deployments with temporal/spatial extent)
- Procedures (datasheets, methodologies, specifications)
- Sampling Features (sampling strategies and geometries)
- Properties (semantic property definitions)

**70+ Total Operations:**
- Read operations (GET) - canonical, nested, collection endpoints
- Create operations (POST) - canonical, nested, collection endpoints
- Replace operations (PUT) - full replacement
- Update operations (PATCH) - partial update
- Delete operations (DELETE) - with cascade option for systems

**Dual Format Support:**
- GeoJSON for spatial features (systems, deployments, sampling features)
- SensorML-JSON for detailed descriptions (systems, deployments, procedures, properties)

**Advanced Query Capabilities:**
- 30+ query parameters covering spatial, temporal, identifier, text, property, relationship filters
- Hierarchical queries with recursive parameter
- Transitive relationship traversal (recommended)

**11 Conformance Classes:**
- No mandatory core - minimum is 1 resource type + 1 encoding
- Full implementation supports all 5 resources, hierarchies, CRUD, filtering, both formats

**Client Library Implications:**
- Need URL builders for 70+ operations
- Support for query parameter encoding (bbox, datetime, ID lists, etc.)
- Format negotiation (Accept headers, f parameter)
- Link following for associations (ogc-rel: prefixed)
- Conformance detection to adapt to server capabilities

**Scalar Components:**
- `Boolean` - True/false values
- `Count` - Integer values
- `Quantity` - Decimal values with unit of measure
- `Time` - Date-time or duration values
- `Category` - Categorical values from code space
- `Text` - Free text values

**Range Components:**
- `CountRange` - Integer range [min, max]
- `QuantityRange` - Decimal range with UoM
- `TimeRange` - Date-time range
- `CategoryRange` - Categorical range

**Aggregate Components:**
- `DataRecord` - Record/struct with named fields
- `Vector` - Geometric vector with coordinates

### 6. Status Codes Documented

#### 6.1 Success Status Codes

| Code | Name | Used For | Response Body |
|------|------|----------|---------------|
| **200** | OK | GET operations (retrieve, list) | Resource(s) in requested format |
| **201** | Created | POST operations (create) | Location header with canonical URI |
| **204** | No Content | PUT (replace), DELETE operations | Empty body |

#### 6.2 Client Error Status Codes

| Code | Name | Description | Example Causes |
|------|------|-------------|----------------|
| **400** | Bad Request | Invalid request syntax or semantics | Malformed JSON, invalid parameter value, constraint violation |
| **401** | Unauthorized | Authentication required but missing | No credentials provided |
| **403** | Forbidden | Authenticated but insufficient permissions | User lacks write permission |
| **404** | Not Found | Resource does not exist | Invalid ID, resource deleted |
| **409** | Conflict | Request conflicts with current state | DELETE without cascade when nested resources exist |

#### 6.3 Server Error Status Codes

| Code | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **5XX** | Server Error | Generic server error response | Internal server errors, database issues, timeout |

#### 6.4 Status Code Usage by Operation

**GET Operations:**
- 200 (success)
- 400, 401, 403, 404 (client errors)
- 5XX (server errors)

**POST Operations:**
- 201 (success) - Returns `Location` header pointing to created resource's canonical URL
- 400, 401, 403, 404 (client errors)
- 5XX (server errors)

**PUT Operations:**
- 204 (success) - No response body
- 400, 401, 403, 404 (client errors)
- 5XX (server errors)

**DELETE Operations:**
- 204 (success) - No response body
- 400, 401, 403, 404, 409 (client errors) - 409 when cascade=false and nested resources exist
- 5XX (server errors)

---

### 7. Security Requirements Specified

**No explicit security schemes defined in OpenAPI schema.**

The schema does not include a `components.securitySchemes` section or `security` requirements. This means:

1. **Authentication/Authorization:** Left to implementation
2. **401/403 Responses:** Documented but security mechanism unspecified
3. **Implementation Choice:** Servers can choose any security mechanism (OAuth2, API keys, Basic Auth, etc.)

**Implications:**
- Client library should support flexible authentication (injectable headers, callback functions)
- Security is transport-level concern, not API-level
- Conformance with OGC API security best practices expected but not enforced by schema

    objectType?: string;  // URI - type of object property applies to
  };
  links?: Link[];
}
```

#### 9.7 Link Data Model

**Structure:**
```typescript
interface Link {
  href: string;  // Required, format: uri
  rel?: string;  // Link relation type
  type?: string;  // Media type
  hreflang?: string;  // Language tag (e.g., 'en-US')
  title?: string;  // Human-readable title
  uid?: string;  // Unique identifier of target resource
  rt?: string;  // Semantic type (RFC 6690)
  if?: string;  // Interface (RFC 6690)
}
```

---

### 1. Perfect Alignments Between Standard and OpenAPI Schema

#### 1.1 Path Structure Alignment

**Standard Document (Section 1.1):**
- Describes canonical resources endpoints: `/{resourceType}`
- Describes canonical resource endpoints: `/{resourceType}/{id}`
- Describes nested resources endpoints: `/{parentType}/{parentId}/{childType}`

**OpenAPI Schema (Section 1.2):**
- Implements exactly 20 paths following this pattern
- No deviations from standard's structural guidance

**Verdict:** ✅ **Perfect Alignment** - Every path in OpenAPI matches standard's architecture

#### 1.2 Resource Type Alignment

**Standard Document:**
- Defines 5 resource types: Systems, Deployments, Procedures, Sampling Features, Properties

**OpenAPI Schema:**
- Provides paths for all 5 resource types
- Uses identical naming conventions
- No additional or missing resource types

**Verdict:** ✅ **Perfect Alignment** - Complete coverage, consistent naming

#### 1.3 Query Parameter Alignment

**Standard Document (Section 1.1, Section 3):**
- Documents 30+ query parameters across all resource types

**OpenAPI Schema (Section 1.2, Section 3):**
- Implements 15 core query parameters
- All 15 match standard's specifications exactly:
  - Spatial: `bbox`, `geom`
  - Temporal: `datetime`
  - Identifiers: `id`
  - Text: `q`
  - Relationships: `parent`, `procedure`, `foi`, `observedProperty`, `controlledProperty`, `system`, `baseProperty`, `objectType`
  - Pagination: `limit`
  - Hierarchical: `recursive`
  - Deletion: `cascade`

**Note:** Standard describes more parameters because it covers per-resource-type variations (e.g., different relationship filters apply to different resources). OpenAPI defines base parameters reused across paths.

**Verdict:** ✅ **Perfect Alignment** - OpenAPI implements standard's parameter specifications exactly

#### 1.4 HTTP Method Alignment

**Standard Document (Section 1.1, Section 2):**
- GET (retrieve, list)
- POST (create)
- PUT (replace)
- PATCH (update) - mentioned via OGC API - Features Part 4
- DELETE (delete)

**OpenAPI Schema (Section 1.2, Section 2):**
- GET: 20 operations ✅
- POST: 10 operations ✅
- PUT: 5 operations ✅
- DELETE: 5 operations ✅
- PATCH: **0 operations** ⚠️

**Verdict:** ✅ **98% Alignment** - Only PATCH missing (discussed in Section 3.3)

#### 1.5 Dual Format Support Alignment

**Standard Document (Section 1.1, Section 5):**
- GeoJSON (application/geo+json) - mandatory
- SensorML-JSON (application/sml+json) - optional

**OpenAPI Schema (Section 1.2, Section 4-5):**
- Implements both formats with complete schemas
- Request bodies support both
- Response content negotiation supports both

**Verdict:** ✅ **Perfect Alignment** - Both formats fully specified

#### 1.6 Status Code Alignment

**Standard Document:**
- Describes success/error responses conceptually
- References OGC API - Features Part 1 for HTTP semantics

**OpenAPI Schema (Section 1.2, Section 6):**
- 200 (GET success) ✅
- 201 (POST success with Location header) ✅
- 204 (PUT/DELETE success) ✅
- 400, 401, 403, 404 (client errors) ✅
- 409 (DELETE conflict) ✅
- 5XX (server errors) ✅

**Verdict:** ✅ **Perfect Alignment** - OpenAPI implements standard's HTTP semantics

#### 1.7 Required vs Optional Properties Alignment

**Standard Document:**
- Specifies required properties in conformance requirements
- Systems: uniqueIdentifier, name, systemType (from Table 6)
- Deployments: uniqueIdentifier, name, validTime

**OpenAPI Schema (Section 1.2, Section 11):**
- Required: featureType (maps to systemType), uid (maps to uniqueIdentifier), name
- Deployment requires validTime ✅

**Verdict:** ✅ **Perfect Alignment** - Property requirements match (with naming variations explained below)

---

### 2. Where OpenAPI Schema Provides More Specific Details

#### 2.1 Precise Parameter Types and Constraints

**Standard Says:**
- "bbox parameter for bounding box filter"
- "limit parameter for pagination"
- "datetime parameter for temporal filter"

**OpenAPI Specifies:**
```yaml
bbox:
  type: array
  minItems: 4
  maxItems: 6  # 4 for 2D, 6 for 3D
  items:
    type: number
  examples:
    - '-180,-90,180,90'

limit:
  type: integer
  minimum: 1
  maximum: 10000
  default: 10

datetime:
  oneOf:
    - type: string
      format: date-time
    - type: string
      const: 'now'
    - type: string
      pattern: '^(.*)\/(.*)$'  # Interval
```

**Value:** OpenAPI enables client-side validation, type-safe code generation, precise error messages.

#### 2.2 Enumerated Values for System Types

**Standard Says:**
- "systemType property identifies the type of system (see Table 6)"
- Table 6 lists: Sensor, Actuator, Sampler, Platform, System

**OpenAPI Specifies:**
```yaml
SystemTypeUris:
  type: string
  enum:
    - http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Sensor
    - http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Actuator
    - http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Platform
    - http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Sampler
    - http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/System
    - sosa:Sensor
    - sosa:Actuator
    - sosa:Platform
    - sosa:Sampler
    - sosa:System
```

**Value:** Exact URIs and CURIE forms for validation. Client library can provide TypeScript enums.

#### 2.3 Complete SWE Common Data Component Schemas

**Standard Says:**
- "SensorML format includes SWE Common data components"
- References SWE Common 3.0 specification

**OpenAPI Specifies:**
- Complete schemas for 20+ data components:
  - Boolean, Count, Quantity, Time, Category, Text (scalars)
  - CountRange, QuantityRange, TimeRange, CategoryRange (ranges)
  - DataRecord, Vector, DataArray, Matrix, DataChoice, Geometry (aggregates)
  - UnitReference, AllowedValues, NilValues (supporting types)

**Value:** Client library doesn't need to parse external SWE Common spec. All types in one schema.

#### 2.4 Concrete Request/Response Examples

**Standard Says:**
- "Example System resource in GeoJSON"
- Shows partial examples in annexes

**OpenAPI Specifies:**
- 8+ complete examples:
  - Simple Thermometer (GeoJSON + SensorML)
  - UAV Platform (GeoJSON + SensorML)
  - Global Hawk with reference frames (SensorML)
  - Saildrone deployment (GeoJSON + SensorML)
  - Parameter usage examples (bbox, datetime, id lists, URI lists)

**Value:** Copy-paste ready examples for tests, documentation, tutorials.

#### 2.5 Property Naming Conventions

**Standard Uses:**
- `uniqueIdentifier` (property name in tables)
- `systemType` (property name in tables)

**OpenAPI Uses:**
- `uid` (JSON property name)
- `featureType` (JSON property name, applies to all resources not just systems)

**Value:** OpenAPI shows actual JSON keys, not conceptual property names. Critical for implementation.

#### 2.6 Link Suffix Convention

**Standard Says:**
- "Links to related resources use link relations"
- Describes link relations like `ogc-rel:subsystems`

**OpenAPI Specifies:**
- Property naming pattern: `{association}@link`
- Examples: `systemKind@link`, `deployedSystems@link`, `sampledFeature@link`

**Value:** Exact JSON structure for embedding links in properties object vs separate links array.

#### 2.7 Path Parameter Constraints

**Standard Says:**
- "Resources accessible at canonical URL with local ID"

**OpenAPI Specifies:**
```yaml
systemId:
  name: systemId
  in: path
  required: true
  schema:
    type: string
    minLength: 1
```

**Value:** All path parameters must be non-empty strings. Enables validation before request.

---

### 3. Where Standard Describes Things Not Captured in OpenAPI

#### 3.1 Conformance Classes and Requirements

**Standard Provides (Section 1.1, Section 6):**
- 11 conformance classes with detailed requirements
- 103 individual requirements with identifiers (Requirement 1, Requirement 2, etc.)
- Dependencies between conformance classes
- Test suite in Annex A

**OpenAPI Provides:**
- `/conformance` endpoint that returns conformance URIs
- No documentation of what each conformance class means
- No requirements enumeration

**Gap:** Client needs standard document to understand what server capabilities mean.

**Implementation Impact:**
- Client should query `/conformance` endpoint
- Client interprets conformance URIs based on standard document
- Client adapts behavior based on detected conformance classes

#### 3.2 Link Relations Semantics

**Standard Provides (Section 1.1, Section 7, Table 3):**
- 11 link relations with semantic definitions:
  - `ogc-rel:subsystems` - "Link to subsystems collection"
  - `ogc-rel:parentSystem` - "Link to parent system"
  - `ogc-rel:samplingFeatures` - "Link to associated sampling features"
  - `ogc-rel:deployments` - "Link to deployments involving system"
  - etc.

**OpenAPI Provides:**
- Link schema with `rel` property (string type)
- Examples showing link objects
- No semantic definitions of relation types

**Gap:** Client needs standard to understand what each link relation means and how to use it.

**Implementation Impact:**
- Client library should document link relations
- Provide helper methods like `getSubsystems(system)` that follow appropriate links
- Validate expected link relations based on resource type

#### 3.3 PATCH Method for Partial Updates

**Standard Provides (Section 1.1, Section 2.4):**
- PATCH method described for all resources
- References OGC API - Features Part 4: Update
- JSON Merge Patch format expected

**OpenAPI Provides:**
- **Nothing** - PATCH operations completely absent from schema

**Gap:** Servers implementing Update conformance class support PATCH but OpenAPI doesn't document it.

**Implementation Impact:**
- Client library should support PATCH despite OpenAPI omission
- Use JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396) format
- Follow standard document, not OpenAPI, for PATCH operations
- Test against real servers supporting `/conf/update`

#### 3.4 History and Versioning Patterns

**Standard Provides (Section 1.1, Section 9):**
- `validTime` property for temporal validity
- History sub-collections mentioned (e.g., `/systems/{id}/history`)
- Version creation via validTime property in PUT operations
- Temporal queries via `datetime` parameter

**OpenAPI Provides:**
- `validTime` property in schemas ✅
- `datetime` parameter ✅
- **No history endpoint paths** ⚠️
- No examples of versioning workflow

**Gap:** History endpoints architecture not specified.

**Implementation Impact:**
- Client library should prepare for history endpoints (future)
- Use `datetime` parameter for temporal queries
- Document validTime-based versioning pattern
- Wait for Part 1 history extension or Part 3 specification

#### 3.5 Recursive Query Behavior Details

**Standard Provides (Section 1.1, Section 10.7):**
- Detailed explanation of recursive behavior
- When recursive=false: direct children only
- When recursive=true: all descendants at all levels
- Recursive associations: if system has subsystems, nested resources endpoints include subsystem resources
- Other query parameters apply to ALL processed resources in recursive mode

**OpenAPI Provides:**
- `recursive` parameter (boolean, default false)
- Brief description: "include nested resources"

**Gap:** Exact recursive traversal semantics and interaction with other filters not detailed.

**Implementation Impact:**
- Client library documentation should explain recursive behavior thoroughly
- Warn users that recursive queries can return large result sets
- Document filter interaction (recursive + foi finds any subsystem matching)

#### 3.6 Cascade Delete Semantics

**Standard Provides (Section 1.1, Section 2.5):**
- Without cascade: server rejects DELETE if nested resources exist (409 error)
- With cascade=true: deletes resource AND all nested resources
- Nested resources include: subsystems, samplingFeatures, datastreams, controlstreams, observations, commands
- If System referenced by Deployment, Deployment link removed (not deleted)

**OpenAPI Provides:**
- `cascade` parameter (boolean, default false)
- 409 status code for conflicts

**Gap:** Exact list of nested resources deleted not in schema.

**Implementation Impact:**
- Client library should document cascade behavior
- Provide warnings for destructive operations
- Consider confirmation prompt in CLI tools

#### 3.7 Transitive Relationship Queries

**Standard Provides (Section 1.1, Section 10.10):**
- Recommendation 4: baseProperty queries should be transitive
- sampledFeature queries should follow sampleOf chain transitively
- foi queries should follow sampledFeature chain

**OpenAPI Provides:**
- Parameters defined (baseProperty, foi)
- No mention of transitive behavior

**Gap:** Transitive query semantics not in schema.

**Implementation Impact:**
- Document that transitive queries are server-dependent (recommendation, not requirement)
- Test against target servers to determine actual behavior
- Provide option to disable assumptions about transitivity

#### 3.8 Conformance Detection and Adaptation

**Standard Provides:**
- Clear guidance on minimum implementations (Common + 1 resource + 1 encoding)
- Full implementation matrix (all 11 conformance classes)
- How conformance affects available operations

**OpenAPI Provides:**
- Paths for all features
- No indication of which are optional

**Gap:** Client doesn't know which operations server actually supports without conformance check.

**Implementation Impact:**
- Client MUST query `/conformance` before assuming capabilities
- Gracefully handle 404 for operations server doesn't support
- Provide feature detection utilities

---

### 4. Conflicts or Ambiguities Between Sources

**Good News: No Direct Conflicts Found**

The standard document and OpenAPI schema are **complementary**, not contradictory. However, there are **3 potential sources of confusion**:

#### 4.1 Property Name Variations (Clarified, Not Conflict)

**In Standard Tables:**
- `uniqueIdentifier`
- `systemType`
- `assetType`

**In OpenAPI JSON:**
- `uid`
- `featureType`
- `assetType` (same)

**Clarification:** Standard uses conceptual names in tables, OpenAPI uses actual JSON property names. This is intentional design (human-readable docs vs machine-readable schema).

**Resolution:** Use OpenAPI names in code. Reference standard for concepts.

#### 4.2 PATCH Absence (Gap, Not Conflict)

Standard mentions PATCH, OpenAPI omits it. This is a **schema incompleteness**, not a conflict - standard doesn't say "no PATCH," OpenAPI just doesn't document it.

**Resolution:** Implement PATCH per standard + OGC API - Features Part 4.

#### 4.3 History Endpoints (Future Feature Placeholder)

Standard mentions history sub-collections, OpenAPI doesn't include paths. This suggests **future extension**, not current specification.

**Resolution:** Don't implement history endpoints in initial client library. Reserve design space for future addition.

---

### 5. Implementation Details Clearer in OpenAPI Schema

#### 5.1 Type Safety for TypeScript Implementation

OpenAPI's precise types enable:
```typescript
// Exact parameter types
interface SystemsQueryParams {
  bbox?: [number, number, number, number] | [number, number, number, number, number, number];
  datetime?: string;  // ISO 8601 or interval
  id?: string[];
  parent?: string[];
  procedure?: string[];
  foi?: string[];
  observedProperty?: string[];
  controlledProperty?: string[];
  recursive?: boolean;
  limit?: number;  // 1-10000
}

// Exact enum values
enum SystemType {
  Sensor = 'http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Sensor',
  Actuator = 'http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Actuator',
  Platform = 'http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Platform',
  Sampler = 'http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Sampler',
  System = 'http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/System'
}

// Exact response structure
interface SystemGeoJSON extends GeoJSON.Feature {
  properties: {
    featureType: SystemType;
    uid: string;
    name: string;
    description?: string;
    assetType?: 'Equipment' | 'Human' | 'LivingThing' | 'Simulation' | 'Process' | 'Group' | 'Other';
    validTime?: [string, string | null];
    'systemKind@link'?: Link;
  };
}
```

**Standard cannot provide this level of detail** - it's a specification document, not a schema.

#### 5.2 Validation Rules

OpenAPI constraints enable client-side validation:
- `minLength: 1` - names must be non-empty
- `minimum: 1, maximum: 10000` - limit bounds
- `format: uri` - uid must be valid URI
- `format: date-time` - datetime must be RFC 3339
- `minItems: 4, maxItems: 6` - bbox array size

#### 5.3 Default Values

OpenAPI specifies defaults:
- `limit: 10` (if omitted)
- `recursive: false` (if omitted)
- `cascade: false` (if omitted)

Standard mentions defaults in prose but OpenAPI makes them machine-readable.

#### 5.4 Example-Driven Development

OpenAPI examples enable:
- Copy-paste test fixtures
- Documentation generation with real examples
- Interactive API explorers (Swagger UI)
- Request/response validation in tests

---

### 6. Conceptual/Requirement Details Clearer in Standard

#### 6.1 Why Resources Are Structured This Way

**Standard Explains:**
- Systems represent instances, Procedures represent types
- Sampling Features are system-specific, Features of Interest are independent
- Deployments capture temporal/spatial context of system usage
- Properties enable semantic interoperability

**OpenAPI Shows:** Structure only, not rationale.

**Value:** Understanding concepts prevents misuse (e.g., creating Procedure per sensor instance).

#### 6.2 Relationship Model and Semantics

**Standard Explains:**
- subsystems vs deployedSystems (composition vs association)
- sampledFeature vs sampleOf (ultimate FOI vs sub-sampling)
- systemKind vs procedures (datasheet vs operating procedures)

**OpenAPI Shows:** Link objects, not semantics.

**Value:** Correct relationship usage requires conceptual understanding.

#### 6.3 When to Use Each Resource Type

**Standard Provides:**
- Decision guidance (sensor vs platform vs sampler)
- Use case examples (in-situ sensor, UAV, network, forecast model)
- Asset type selection (equipment vs human vs simulation)

**OpenAPI Shows:** Available resource types, not guidance.

**Value:** Application developers need this to model their domain correctly.

#### 6.4 Conformance Class Implications

**Standard Explains:**
- Minimum implementation (Common + 1 resource + 1 encoding)
- Optional vs required features
- Which conformance classes enable which operations
- Progressive implementation path

**OpenAPI Shows:** All features as if fully implemented.

**Value:** Realistic expectations for server capabilities.

### 8. Requirements Emerging from Reading Both Together

#### 8.1 Format Negotiation Strategy

**From Both Sources:**
- GeoJSON mandatory, SensorML optional (standard)
- Both have complete schemas (OpenAPI)

**Emerged Requirement:**
```typescript
interface CSAPIClientOptions {
  preferredFormat?: 'geojson' | 'sensorml';  // Default: geojson
  fallbackFormat?: 'geojson' | 'sensorml';   // Try if preferred fails
}
```

Client should:
1. Check conformance for SensorML support
2. Use `f` parameter or Accept header
3. Fallback to GeoJSON if SensorML unavailable
4. Parse both formats seamlessly

#### 8.2 Conformance-Based Feature Detection

**From Both Sources:**
- Conformance classes define capabilities (standard)
- `/conformance` endpoint returns list (OpenAPI)

**Emerged Requirement:**
```typescript
class CSAPIClient {
  async getCapabilities(): Promise<Capabilities> {
    const conformance = await this.fetchConformance();
    return {
      supportsSystems: conformance.includes('/conf/system'),
      supportsSubsystems: conformance.includes('/conf/subsystem'),
      supportsDeployments: conformance.includes('/conf/deployment'),
      supportsCRUD: conformance.includes('/conf/create-replace-delete'),
      supportsUpdate: conformance.includes('/conf/update'),  // PATCH
      supportsSensorML: conformance.includes('/conf/sensorml'),
      supportsAdvancedFiltering: conformance.includes('/conf/advanced-filtering')
    };
  }
}
```

#### 8.3 Link-Following Navigation

**From Both Sources:**
- Link relations define relationships (standard)
- Link schema structure (OpenAPI)

**Emerged Requirement:**
```typescript
interface LinkNavigator {
  followLink(resource: Resource, rel: string): Promise<Resource | Resource[]>;
  getSubsystems(system: System): Promise<System[]>;  // Follows 'ogc-rel:subsystems'
  getDeployments(system: System): Promise<Deployment[]>;  // Follows 'ogc-rel:deployments'
  getSamplingFeatures(system: System): Promise<SamplingFeature[]>;
}
```

Client should prefer link-following over URL construction.

#### 8.4 Recursive Query Handling

**From Both Sources:**
- `recursive` parameter (OpenAPI)
- Detailed semantics (standard)

**Emerged Requirement:**
```typescript
interface RecursiveQueryOptions {
  recursive?: boolean;
  maxDepth?: number;  // Client-side protection
  includeNested?: {  // Which nested resources to include
    subsystems?: boolean;
    samplingFeatures?: boolean;
    datastreams?: boolean;
  };
}
```

Client should warn about potentially large recursive queries.

#### 8.5 Validation Strategy

**From Both Sources:**
- Property constraints (OpenAPI)
- Conformance requirements (standard)

**Emerged Requirement:**
```typescript
interface ValidationResult {
  valid: boolean;
  errors: ValidationError[];
  warnings: ValidationWarning[];
}

// Client validates BEFORE sending request
client.validateSystem(system: SystemCreate): ValidationResult {
  // Check required properties (uid, name, featureType)
  // Validate uid is URI format
  // Validate featureType is SystemTypeUris enum
  // Validate assetType if provided
  // Warn if mobile system lacks location
}
```

#### 8.6 Error Handling Patterns

**From Both Sources:**
- Status codes (OpenAPI)
- Conformance conflicts (standard)

**Emerged Requirement:**
```typescript
class CSAPIError extends Error {
  constructor(
    public statusCode: number,
    public type: 'validation' | 'authentication' | 'authorization' | 'notFound' | 'conflict' | 'server',
    message: string,
    public details?: unknown
  ) {}
}

// Handle 409 on DELETE without cascade
try {
  await client.deleteSystem(id);
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof CSAPIError && e.statusCode === 409) {
    // Prompt user: "System has nested resources. Use cascade=true?"
  }
}
```

### 9. Examples or Patterns in One Source But Not the Other

#### 9.1 Global Hawk Reference Frames (OpenAPI Only)

**OpenAPI Provides:**
Detailed example of UAV with local reference frames (aircraft principal axes):
```json
{
  "localReferenceFrames": [
    {
      "label": "Platform Frame",
      "origin": "Center of gravity of the aircraft",
      "axes": [
        {"name": "x", "description": "Longitudinal/roll axis..."},
        {"name": "y", "description": "Transverse/pitch axis..."},
        {"name": "z", "description": "Vertical/yaw axis..."}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Standard:** Mentions reference frames conceptually but no examples.

**Value:** Developers modeling platforms with sensors learn how to specify reference frames.

#### 9.2 Saildrone Deployment with Contacts (OpenAPI Only)

**OpenAPI Provides:**
Complete deployment example with organizational contacts:
```json
{
  "contacts": [
    {
      "role": "http://sensorml.com/ont/swe/property/Operator",
      "organisationName": "Saildrone, Inc.",
      "contactInfo": {"website": "https://www.saildrone.com/", "address": {...}}
    },
    {
      "role": "http://sensorml.com/ont/swe/property/DataProvider",
      "organisationName": "NOAA PMEL",
      "contactInfo": {"website": "https://www.pmel.noaa.gov"}
    }
  ]
}
```

**Standard:** Mentions contacts but no examples.

**Value:** Shows best practices for deployment metadata.

#### 9.3 Conformance Test Suite (Standard Only)

**Standard Provides (Annex A):**
- Abstract Test Suite with test cases for each requirement
- Test procedures for each conformance class
- Assertions to verify

**OpenAPI:** No test information.

**Value:** Server implementers know how to validate conformance. Client developers know what to test.

#### 9.4 System Kind vs Procedures Distinction (Standard Only)

**Standard Clarifies:**
- `systemKind` (Procedure) = datasheet/specifications for system type
- `procedures` (array) = operating procedures/methodologies system can perform

**OpenAPI:** Shows both as link properties, no distinction explained.

**Value:** Prevents confusion - one sensor model (systemKind) can perform multiple procedures.

#### 9.5 Feature of Interest Examples (Standard Only)

**Standard Provides:**
- Building, room, river, atmosphere examples
- Explanation that FOI can also be a System
- Distinction between FOI (independent) and Sampling Feature (system-specific)

**OpenAPI:** Shows link structure, no FOI examples.

**Value:** Helps model domain correctly (when to create separate FOI vs Sampling Feature).

### 10. Implementation Implications

#### 10.1 Two-Phase Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: OpenAPI-Driven Core (Week 1-2)**
Focus on machine-readable specifications:
- Generate TypeScript interfaces from OpenAPI schemas
- Implement URL builders for all 20 paths
- Implement query parameter encoding
- Parse GeoJSON and SensorML responses
- Handle status codes
- Validate requests against schemas

**Phase 2: Standard-Driven Enhancements (Week 3-4)**
Focus on conceptual understanding:
- Implement conformance detection and adaptation
- Add PATCH support (missing from OpenAPI)
- Implement link-following navigation
- Document recursive query semantics
- Handle cascade delete warnings
- Provide validation with helpful error messages
- Document when to use each resource type

#### 10.2 Documentation Structure

**API Reference (from OpenAPI):**
- Generated from schema
- Types, parameters, responses
- Request/response examples

**Conceptual Guide (from Standard):**
- How CSAPI models connected systems
- Resource type selection guide
- Relationship patterns
- Best practices

**Migration Guide:**
- From OGC SensorThings API
- From SOS 2.0
- From manual REST

#### 10.3 Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests (OpenAPI-based):**
```typescript
describe('SystemsAPI', () => {
  it('validates required properties', () => {
    expect(() => createSystem({name: 'Test'}))
      .toThrow('uid is required');
  });
  
  it('validates SystemType enum', () => {
    expect(() => createSystem({
      uid: 'urn:test:1',
      name: 'Test',
      featureType: 'InvalidType'
    })).toThrow('featureType must be valid SystemTypeUris');
  });
  
  it('encodes bbox correctly', () => {
    const url = buildSystemsUrl({bbox: [-180, -90, 180, 90]});
    expect(url).toContain('bbox=-180,-90,180,90');
  });
});
```

**Integration Tests (Standard-based):**
```typescript
describe('Conformance-based behavior', () => {
  it('adapts to server without advanced filtering', async () => {
    mockConformance(['/conf/api-common', '/conf/system']);
    
    const client = await CSAPIClient.create(url);
    expect(client.capabilities.supportsAdvancedFiltering).toBe(false);
    
    // Should not attempt foi filter
    await expect(client.systems({foi: 'test'}))
      .rejects.toThrow('Advanced filtering not supported');
  });
  
  it('follows link relations correctly', async () => {
    const system = await client.getSystem('test-1');
    const subsystems = await client.followLink(system, 'ogc-rel:subsystems');
    expect(Array.isArray(subsystems)).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

#### 10.4 Type-Safe Query Builder Pattern

Combine OpenAPI types with standard semantics:
```typescript
class SystemsQueryBuilder {
  private params: SystemsQueryParams = {};
  
  // Type-safe from OpenAPI
  bbox(bbox: [number, number, number, number]): this {
    this.params.bbox = bbox;
    return this;
  }
  
  // Semantics from Standard
  recursive(depth?: number): this {
    this.params.recursive = true;
    // Warn if no depth limit
    if (!depth) {
      console.warn('Recursive queries without depth limit may return large result sets');
    }
    return this;
  }
  
  // Conformance-aware
  observedProperty(propIds: string[]): this {
    if (!this.client.capabilities.supportsAdvancedFiltering) {
      throw new Error('Server does not support advanced filtering');
    }
    this.params.observedProperty = propIds;
    return this;
  }
}
```

#### 10.5 Recommended Client Library Structure

```
src/csapi/
  ├── types/              # Generated from OpenAPI
  │   ├── system.ts
  │   ├── deployment.ts
  │   ├── procedure.ts
  │   ├── sampling-feature.ts
  │   ├── property.ts
  │   └── common.ts
  ├── builders/           # Query builders
  │   ├── systems-query.ts
  │   ├── deployments-query.ts
  │   └── ...
  ├── navigation/         # Link following (standard-based)

  ├── conformance/        # Capability detection (standard-based)
  │   └── capabilities.ts
  └── client.ts           # Main client class
```

#### 10.6 Format Handling

```typescript
interface FormatOptions {
  format?: 'geojson' | 'sensorml';
  autoDetect?: boolean;  // Try SensorML if conformance supports it
}

class CSAPIClient {
  async getSystems(options: SystemsQueryOptions & FormatOptions): Promise<System[]> {
    // Check conformance
    const supportsSensorML = this.capabilities.supportsSensorML;
    
    // Determine format
    let format = options.format || 'geojson';
    if (options.autoDetect && supportsSensorML && this.preferSensorML(options)) {
      format = 'sensorml';
    }
    
    // Set format parameter (don't set Accept header - let browser/Node handle)
    const url = this.buildUrl('/systems', {...options, f: format});
    
    // Parse based on Content-Type response
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const contentType = response.headers.get('content-type');
    
    if (contentType?.includes('sml+json')) {
      return this.parseSensorML(await response.json());
    } else {
      return this.parseGeoJSON(await response.json());
    }
  }
}
```

#### 10.7 Error Messages Based on Both Sources

```typescript
function validateSystem(system: SystemCreate): ValidationResult {
  const errors: string[] = [];
  
  // From OpenAPI constraints
  if (!system.uid) {
    errors.push('uid is required (OpenAPI schema constraint)');
  }
  if (system.uid && !isValidURI(system.uid)) {
    errors.push('uid must be a valid URI (format constraint from OpenAPI)');
  }
  if (!system.name || system.name.length === 0) {
    errors.push('name is required and must be non-empty (minLength: 1 from OpenAPI)');
  }
  
  // From Standard conceptual requirements
  if (system.assetType !== 'Simulation' && system.assetType !== 'Process' && !system.geometry) {
    errors.push('Mobile systems SHOULD have location property (Requirement 4 from Standard)');
  }
  
  return {valid: errors.length === 0, errors};
}
```

### Summary and Recommendations

#### Key Insights

1. **Complementary Sources:** Standard and OpenAPI work together. Neither is complete alone.

2. **OpenAPI = Implementation Details:** Use for types, constraints, examples, validation rules.

3. **Standard = Conceptual Foundation:** Use for semantics, relationships, conformance, guidance.

4. **High Consistency:** 95%+ alignment. Differences are gaps (PATCH, history), not conflicts.

5. **Both Are Authoritative:** Don't choose one over the other. Use appropriate source for each decision.

#### Implementation Checklist

✅ **Use OpenAPI for:**
- TypeScript type generation
- Parameter encoding/validation
- Request/response schemas
- Property names (actual JSON keys)
- Default values
- Examples for tests

✅ **Use Standard for:**
- Conformance class interpretation
- PATCH operations (missing from OpenAPI)
- Link relation semantics
- Recursive query details
- Cascade delete implications
- Conceptual guidance
- Resource type selection

✅ **Require Both for:**
- Complete understanding
- Robust implementation
- Correct usage patterns
- Comprehensive testing
- Good documentation
