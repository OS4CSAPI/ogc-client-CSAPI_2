## 3. Common Query Patterns

### 3.1 Spatial Filtering

**Pattern:** Find resources within geographic bounds

**Examples:**
```
# City area
GET /systems?bbox=-122.5,37.5,-122.3,37.7

# Global
GET /deployments?bbox=-180,-90,180,90

# Custom CRS (if supported)
GET /systems?bbox=500000,4500000,600000,4600000&bbox-crs=EPSG:3857
```

**Library Support:**
```typescript
// BBox builder
const systems = await client.findSystems({
  bbox: {
    west: -122.5,
    south: 37.5,
    east: -122.3,
    north: 37.7
  }
});

// Or array format
const systems = await client.findSystems({
  bbox: [-122.5, 37.5, -122.3, 37.7]
});
```

---

### 3.2 Temporal Filtering

**Pattern:** Query resources by time range or instant

**Examples:**
```
# Specific day
GET /observations?phenomenonTime=2024-01-15T00:00:00Z/2024-01-16T00:00:00Z

# Since timestamp
GET /datastreams?resultTime=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z/..

# Before timestamp
GET /systems?datetime=../2024-01-01T00:00:00Z

# Latest observation
GET /observations?resultTime=latest

# Current systems (validTime contains now)
GET /systems?datetime=now
```

**Library Support:**
```typescript
// Time range builder
const observations = await datastream.getObservations({
  phenomenonTime: {
    start: '2024-01-15',
    end: '2024-01-16'
  }
});

// Or ISO interval
const observations = await datastream.getObservations({
  phenomenonTime: '2024-01-15/2024-01-16'
});

// Special values
const latest = await datastream.getLatestObservation();

const active = await client.findSystems({
  datetime: 'now'
});
```

---

### 3.3 Property-Based Filtering

**Pattern:** Find resources by observed or controlled properties

**Examples:**
```
# Temperature sensors
GET /systems?observedProperty=http://qudt.org/vocab/quantitykind/Temperature

# Or CURIE format
GET /systems?observedProperty=qudt:Temperature

# Multiple properties
GET /systems?observedProperty=temperature,humidity

# PTZ control
GET /controlstreams?controlledProperty=http://example.org/properties/pan
```

**Library Support:**
```typescript
// Property filter
const sensors = await client.findSystems({
  observedProperty: ['temperature', 'humidity']
});

const actuators = await client.findSystems({
  controlledProperty: 'pan'
});
```

---

### 3.4 Combined Filters

**Pattern:** Multiple filters for precise queries

**Examples:**
```
# Active temp sensors in SF
GET /systems?bbox=-122.5,37.5,-122.3,37.7&observedProperty=temperature&datetime=now

# Recent observations from specific datastream
GET /observations?datastream={id}&phenomenonTime=2024-01-15T00:00:00Z/..&limit=1000

# Deployments in area during time period
GET /deployments?bbox={bbox}&datetime=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z/2024-02-01T00:00:00Z
```

**Library Support:**
```typescript
// Combine multiple filters
const systems = await client.findSystems({
  bbox: [-122.5, 37.5, -122.3, 37.7],
  observedProperty: 'temperature',
  datetime: 'now',
  limit: 50
});
```

---

### 3.5 Recursive Traversal

**Pattern:** Navigate hierarchical relationships

**Examples:**
```
# All nested subsystems
GET /systems/{id}/subsystems?recursive=true

# All deployments including subdeployments
GET /deployments?recursive=true

# Top-level only (default)
GET /systems/{id}/subsystems
GET /systems/{id}/subsystems?recursive=false
```

**Library Support:**
```typescript
// Recursive query
const allSubsystems = await system.getSubsystems({
  recursive: true
});

// Build tree structure
const tree = await system.getHierarchy();
// Returns nested structure: { system, subsystems: [...] }
```

---

### 3.6 Relationship Traversal

**Pattern:** Follow links between related resources

**Examples:**
```
# System relationships
GET /systems/{id}/datastreams
GET /systems/{id}/controlstreams
GET /systems/{id}/deployments
GET /systems/{id}/samplingFeatures
GET /systems/{id}/subsystems

# Datastream relationships
GET /datastreams/{id}/observations
GET /datastreams/{id}/system

# Command relationships
GET /commands/{id}/status
GET /commands/{id}/result
```

**Library Support:**
```typescript
// Relationship navigation
const system = await client.getSystem(id);
const datastreams = await system.getDataStreams();
const observations = await datastreams[0].getObservations();

// Or fluent API
const observations = await client
  .getSystem(id)
  .getDataStreams()
  .then(ds => ds[0].getObservations());
```

---

### 3.7 Pagination Patterns

**Pattern:** Handle large result sets

**Examples:**
```
# First page (default limit: 10)
GET /observations

# Custom page size
GET /observations?limit=1000

# Follow next link
GET /observations?limit=1000
→ Response includes: links: [{ rel: 'next', href: '...' }]
GET {next_href}
```

**Library Support:**
```typescript
// Manual pagination
const page1 = await datastream.getObservations({ limit: 1000 });
if (page1.links.next) {
  const page2 = await client.fetch(page1.links.next);
}

// Auto-pagination
const allObservations = await datastream.getObservations({
  limit: 1000,
  autoPaginate: true
});

// Streaming
for await (const obs of datastream.observationStream()) {
  process(obs);
}
```

---

### 3.8 ID-Based Queries

**Pattern:** Query specific resources by ID

**Examples:**
```
# Single resource
GET /systems/{id}
GET /datastreams/{id}

# Multiple resources by ID list
GET /systems?id=sys1,sys2,sys3

# By unique ID (UID)
GET /systems?uid=urn:uuid:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

**Library Support:**
```typescript
// Single resource
const system = await client.getSystem('sys1');

// Batch fetch
const systems = await client.getSystems(['sys1', 'sys2', 'sys3']);

// By UID
const system = await client.findSystemByUID('urn:uuid:...');
```

---

## 6. Integration Patterns

### 6.1 Map Integration (OpenLayers, Leaflet)

**Purpose:** Display sensor locations on interactive maps

**OpenLayers Example:**
```typescript
import { Vector as VectorLayer } from 'ol/layer';
import { Vector as VectorSource } from 'ol/source';
import { GeoJSON } from 'ol/format';

// Fetch systems as GeoJSON
const systems = await client.findSystems({
  bbox: map.getView().calculateExtent(),
  format: 'application/geo+json'
});

// Add to map
const vectorSource = new VectorSource({
  features: new GeoJSON().readFeatures(systems)
});

const vectorLayer = new VectorLayer({
  source: vectorSource,
  style: styleFunction
});

map.addLayer(vectorLayer);

// Click handler
map.on('click', async (evt) => {
  const feature = map.forEachFeatureAtPixel(evt.pixel, f => f);
  if (feature) {
    const systemId = feature.getId();
    const datastreams = await client.getSystem(systemId).getDataStreams();
    // Show popup with datastreams
  }
});
```

**Requirements:**
- GeoJSON format support
- Accept header negotiation
- Feature ID preservation
- CRS handling
- Popup content generation

---

### 6.2 Charting Integration (Chart.js, D3)

import { Line } from 'react-chartjs-2';

// Fetch observations
const observations = await datastream.getObservations({
  phenomenonTime: ['2024-01-01', '2024-02-01'],
  autoPaginate: true
});

// Extract time series
const data = {
  labels: observations.map(o => new Date(o.phenomenonTime)),
  datasets: [{
    label: datastream.name,
    data: observations.map(o => o.result),
    borderColor: 'rgb(75, 192, 192)',
  }]
};

// Render chart
<Line data={data} options={options} />

// Live updates
client.streamObservations(datastream.id, (obs) => {
  data.labels.push(new Date(obs.phenomenonTime));
  data.datasets[0].data.push(obs.result);
  chart.update();
});
```

**Requirements:**
- Simple observation result extraction
- Temporal parsing
- Real-time update support
- Data transformation helpers

---

### 6.3 Real-Time Update Integration

**Purpose:** Reactive UI updates with observables

**RxJS Example:**
```typescript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

// Create observable from datastream
const observable = new Observable(subscriber => {
  const subscription = client.streamObservations(
    datastreamId,
    (obs) => subscriber.next(obs),
    { interval: 5000, onError: (err) => subscriber.error(err) }
  );
  
  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
});

// Subscribe in component
observable.subscribe({
  next: (observation) => updateUI(observation),
  error: (error) => showError(error)
});
```

**React Hook Example:**
```typescript
function useObservations(datastreamId, interval = 5000) {
  const [observation, setObservation] = useState(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = client.streamObservations(
      datastreamId,
      (obs) => setObservation(obs),
      {
        interval,
        onError: (err) => setError(err)
      }
    );
    
    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
  }, [datastreamId, interval]);
  
  return { observation, error };
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Observable/EventEmitter pattern
- Subscription management

// Request binary format
const observations = await datastream.getObservations({
  phenomenonTime: ['2024-01-01', '2024-02-01'],
  format: 'application/swe+binary'
});

// Parse with SWE Common library
import { SWEBinaryDecoder } from 'swe-common';

const schema = await datastream.getSchema();
const decoder = new SWEBinaryDecoder(schema.observationEncoding);
const decoded = decoder.decode(observations);

// Use decoded observations
decoded.forEach(obs => {
  console.log(obs.phenomenonTime, obs.result);
});
```

**Requirements:**
- Format negotiation
- Schema retrieval
- Binary decoding integration
- Fallback to JSON if binary not supported

---

## 7. Data Transformation Requirements

### 7.1 Format Conversions

#### 7.1.1 GeoJSON ↔ SensorML

**Use Case:** Toggle between spatial view and detailed description

**GeoJSON to SensorML:**
```typescript
const systemGeoJSON = await client.getSystem(id, {
  format: 'application/geo+json'
});

const systemSensorML = await client.getSystem(id, {
  format: 'application/sml+json'
});
// More detailed: inputs, outputs, parameters, etc.
```

**Requirements:**
- Format negotiation via Accept header
- Automatic parsing based on Content-Type
- Format detection helpers

---

#### 7.1.2 JSON ↔ SWE Common Formats

**Use Case:** Efficient transmission vs human readability

{
  "phenomenonTime": "2024-01-15T12:00:00Z",
  "resultTime": "2024-01-15T12:00:01Z",
  "result": 23.5
}
```

**SWE Common CSV:**
```
2024-01-15T12:00:00Z,2024-01-15T12:00:01Z,23.5
2024-01-15T12:05:00Z,2024-01-15T12:05:01Z,23.7
```

**SWE Common Binary:**

- Structured binary encoding
- Requires schema for decoding

**Requirements:**
- Format conversion helpers
- Schema-aware parsing
- Encoding/decoding utilities

---

### 7.2 Observation Result Parsing

**Result Types:**

1. **Measure (single value):**
```typescript
const obs = { result: 23.5 };
const value = obs.result; // number
```

2. **Vector (array of values):**
```typescript
const obs = { result: [23.5, 45.2, 67.8] };
const [x, y, z] = obs.result;
```

3. **Record (structured data):**
```typescript
const obs = {
  result: {
    temperature: 23.5,
    humidity: 45.2,
    pressure: 1013.25
  }
};
const temp = obs.result.temperature;
```

4. **Complex (SWE Common structures):**
```typescript
const obs = {
  result: {
    type: 'DataRecord',
    fields: [
      { name: 'temp', component: { type: 'Quantity', value: 23.5 } },
      { name: 'unit', component: { type: 'Text', value: '°C' } }
    ]
  }
};
```

**Requirements:**
- Result type detection
- Schema-aware parsing
- Type-safe accessors
- Unit extraction

---

### 7.3 Temporal Data Handling

**ISO 8601 Parsing:**
```typescript
// Instant
const instant = parseDateTime('2024-01-15T12:00:00Z');
// Returns Date object

// Interval
const interval = parseInterval('2024-01-01/2024-02-01');
// Returns { start: Date, end: Date }

// Duration
const duration = parseDuration('PT5M');
// Returns 300000 (milliseconds)
```

**Special Values:**
```typescript
// "now" - current time
// "latest" - most recent observation
// ".." - open interval (../2024-01-01 or 2024-01-01/..)
```

**Requirements:**
- ISO 8601 parsing library
- Date/time utilities
- Timezone handling
- Special value support

---

### 7.4 Unit Conversions

**UOM Extraction:**
```typescript
const schema = await datastream.getSchema();
const uom = schema.resultSchema.uom;
// { code: 'Cel', symbol: '°C', label: 'degree Celsius' }
```

**Conversion:**
```typescript
const observation = { result: 23.5 }; // Celsius
const fahrenheit = convertUnit(observation.result, 'Cel', '[degF]');
// 74.3
```

**Requirements:**
- UCUM code parsing
- Unit conversion library
- Unit compatibility checking
- Display formatting

---

## 8. Performance Considerations

### 8.1 Pagination Strategies

**Optimal Page Sizes:**
- **Systems/Deployments:** 10-50 (rich metadata)
- **Datastreams:** 50-100 (moderate metadata)
- **Observations:** 100-1000 (lightweight data)
- **Binary format:** 1000-10000 (highly compressed)

**Pagination Patterns:**

1. **Cursor-based (follow links):**
```typescript
let page = await client.getObservations({ limit: 1000 });
while (page.links.next) {
  process(page.items);
  page = await client.fetch(page.links.next);
}
```

2. **Offset-based:**
```typescript
for (let offset = 0; offset < total; offset += 1000) {
  const page = await client.getObservations({ limit: 1000, offset });
  process(page.items);
}
```

3. **Streaming (memory-efficient):**
```typescript
for await (const observation of datastream.observationStream()) {
  process(observation);
  // No large arrays in memory
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Configurable page sizes
- Link-based pagination
- Streaming API
- Memory management

---

### 8.2 Caching Recommendations

**Cache-Friendly Resources:**

1. **Conformance (long-lived):**
```typescript
const conformance = await client.getConformance();
cache.set('conformance', conformance, { ttl: 86400000 }); // 24 hours
```

2. **System/Deployment metadata (medium-lived):**
```typescript
const system = await client.getSystem(id);
cache.set(`system:${id}`, system, { ttl: 3600000 }); // 1 hour
```

3. **Schemas (locked once observations exist):**
```typescript
const schema = await datastream.getSchema();
cache.set(`schema:${datastream.id}`, schema, { ttl: Infinity }); // Never expire
```

**Don't Cache:**
- Observations (real-time data)
- Command status (changes frequently)
- Live datastreams (current state)

**Cache Invalidation:**
- On PUT/PATCH/DELETE operations
- On 304 Not Modified response
- On ETag mismatch

**Requirements:**
- Cache API integration
- TTL configuration
- ETag support
- Conditional requests

---

### 8.3 Streaming Large Datasets

**Strategies:**

1. **Time Window Chunking:**
```typescript
const start = new Date('2024-01-01');
const end = new Date('2024-12-31');

// Process month by month
for (let month = start; month < end; month.setMonth(month.getMonth() + 1)) {
  const observations = await datastream.getObservations({
    phenomenonTime: [month, new Date(month.getFullYear(), month.getMonth() + 1, 0)]
  });
  process(observations);
}
```

2. **Binary Format:**
```typescript
// 10-100x size reduction
const observations = await datastream.getObservations({
  format: 'application/swe+binary'
});
```

3. **Parallel Requests:**
```typescript
// Independent datastreams can be fetched in parallel
const results = await Promise.all(
  datastreams.map(ds => ds.getObservations({ limit: 1000 }))
);
```

4. **Async Iteration:**
```typescript
for await (const observation of datastream.observationStream({
  phenomenonTime: ['2024-01-01', '2024-12-31']
})) {
  await processAndStore(observation);
  // Process one at a time, no memory overflow
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Chunking utilities
- Binary format support
- Parallel request management
- Async iterators

---

### 8.4 Real-Time Update Optimization

**Polling Strategies:**

1. **Fixed interval:**
```typescript
// Simple, predictable
setInterval(() => fetchLatest(), 5000);
```

2. **Exponential backoff (no new data):**
```typescript
let interval = 5000;
const poll = async () => {
  const obs = await fetchLatest();
  if (obs.length === 0) {
    interval = Math.min(interval * 1.5, 30000); // Max 30 seconds
  } else {
    interval = 5000; // Reset
  }
  setTimeout(poll, interval);
};
```

3. **Incremental fetch:**
```typescript
let lastResultTime = null;
const poll = async () => {
  const filter = lastResultTime
    ? { resultTime: `${lastResultTime}/..` }
    : { resultTime: 'latest' };
  
  const observations = await datastream.getObservations(filter);
  if (observations.length > 0) {
    lastResultTime = observations[observations.length - 1].resultTime;
    update(observations);
  }
  setTimeout(poll, 5000);
};
```

**Recommendations:**
- Dashboard monitoring: 5-10 seconds
- Real-time critical: 1-2 seconds
- Historical analysis: No polling

**Requirements:**
- Configurable poll interval
- Backoff strategies
- Incremental fetch support
- Memory-efficient updates

## 9. Library Design Implications

### 9.1 API Design Patterns

**Resource-Centric Design:**
```typescript
// Objects represent resources
const system = await client.getSystem(id);
const datastreams = await system.getDataStreams();
const observations = await datastreams[0].getObservations();
```

**Fluent API:**
```typescript
// Method chaining
const observations = await client
  .findSystems({ bbox })
  .then(systems => systems[0].getDataStreams())
  .then(datastreams => datastreams[0].getObservations());
```

**Builder Pattern:**
```typescript
// Query builder
const systems = await client
  .systems()

### 9.2 Error Handling Philosophy

**Approach:** Exceptions for programmer errors, null/empty for missing data

```typescript
// Programmer error - throw exception
const system = await client.getSystem(null); // throws TypeError

// Missing data - return null or empty
const system = await client.getSystem('nonexistent'); // returns null

// Network error - throw specific exception
const system = await client.getSystem('sys1'); // throws NetworkError on timeout
```

**Error Hierarchy:**
```
CSAPIError (base)
├── NetworkError (timeout, connection failed)
├── AuthenticationError (401)
├── AuthorizationError (403)
├── ValidationError (400)
├── ResourceNotFoundError (404)
├── ConflictError (409)
└── ServerError (5XX)
```

---

### 9.3 Promise vs Observable

**Promises for single requests:**
```typescript
const system = await client.getSystem(id);
```

**Observables for streams:**
```typescript
const subscription = datastream.observe().subscribe({
  next: (obs) => update(obs),
  error: (err) => handle(err)
});
```

**Hybrid approach:**
```typescript
// Return promise for single value
getLatestObservation(): Promise<Observation>

// Return observable for stream
streamObservations(): Observable<Observation>
```

---

### 9.4 Configuration Options

**Client Configuration:**
```typescript
const client = new CSAPIClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.example.org/csapi',
  auth: {
    type: 'bearer',
    token: '...'
  },
  timeout: 30000,
  retry: {
    retries: 3,
    backoff: 'exponential'
  },
  cache: {
    enabled: true,
    ttl: {
      conformance: 86400000,
      systems: 3600000,
      schemas: Infinity
    }
  },
  pagination: {
    defaultLimit: 100,
    maxLimit: 1000
  },
  formats: {
    prefer: 'application/geo+json',
    fallback: 'application/json'
  }
});
```

### Convenience Method Priorities

**P0 (Must-have):**
1. findSystemsInArea
2. getLatestObservations
3. streamObservations
4. sendCommandAndWait
5. paginateAll

**P1 (Should-have):**
6. getObservationsInRange
7. getSystemHierarchy
8. checkCommandFeasibility
9. resolveLinks
10. checkServerCapabilities

**P2 (Nice-to-have):**
11. findDataStreams
12. getDeploymentData
13. buildBboxQuery
14. buildTimeRange
15. formatObservation
16. validateObservationSchema
17. waitForCommandCompletion

### Integration Requirements

**Essential:**
- GeoJSON format for mapping
- JSON format for charting
- Polling for real-time updates

**Advanced:**
- SWE Common binary for large datasets
- Observable pattern for reactive UIs
- Streaming for memory efficiency

### Performance Targets

- **Page sizes:** 100-1000 observations
- **Poll interval:** 5-10 seconds for dashboards
- **Cache TTL:** 24h conformance, 1h systems, ∞ schemas
- **Timeout:** 30 seconds default
- **Max retries:** 3-5 with exponential backoff

This usage scenario analysis provides comprehensive guidance for implementing a client library that supports real-world CSAPI applications with optimal developer experience and performance.
