## Section 2.1: CSAPI Part 2 Standard Document Analysis

**Document:** [OGC API – Connected Systems Part 2: Dynamic Data](https://docs.ogc.org/is/23-002/23-002.html)  
**Date:** 2026-01-31  
**Status:** Complete

### Overview

CSAPI Part 2 extends Part 1 (Feature Resources) to handle **dynamic data** flowing to and from connected systems. While Part 1 focused on static metadata (Systems, Deployments, Procedures, Sampling Features, Properties), Part 2 defines resources for observations and commands that change over time.

**Key Architectural Principles:**

1. **Observations and Commands Are Not Features:** Deliberate design choice to separate concrete/virtual objects (Features of Interest) from dynamic data containers
2. **Bridge Between Static and Dynamic:** Part 1 Systems connect to Part 2 DataStreams and ControlStreams
3. **Real-Time and Historical:** Resources support both live streaming and historical data access
4. **Multiple Encoding Formats:** JSON, SWE Common JSON, SWE Common Text (CSV), SWE Common Binary for efficient transmission
5. **Pub/Sub Integration:** Part 3 (future) will define pub/sub protocol bindings

**Scope Statement:**
"Part 2 of the API implements the SSN concepts allowing exchange of dynamic (possibly real-time) data flowing to and from various types of connected systems (e.g., sensors, actuators, platforms)."

---

### Dynamic Data Resource Types

Part 2 defines **6 new resource types** for dynamic data:

#### 2.1 DataStream

**Definition:** Collection of Observations acquired by the same System, sharing the same observed properties

**Purpose:**
- Represents data feeds coming out of Systems
- Containers for Observations
- Used for receiving/ingesting real-time Observations

### Schema Operations

Part 2 provides schema operations for variable-structure resources:

#### 5.1 DataStream Schema Operation

**Purpose:** Different observation schema needed for each datastream (result type and observed properties vary)

**Endpoint:** `/datastreams/{id}/schema`

**Parameter:**
- `obsFormat` (required, string) - Media type of desired observation format
- Examples: `application/json`, `application/swe+csv`, `application/swe+binary`

**Response:**
- 200 (OK) - Single schema corresponding to format
- Schema resource content defined by encoding (not necessarily JSON schema)
- 400 (Bad Request) - Invalid format parameter

**Multiple Formats:**
- Server MAY offer multiple observation formats per datastream
- DataStream resource lists supported formats in `formats` property (List<String>)
- Client requests schema for each format separately
- Server MAY automatically convert observations between formats and generate equivalent schemas

**URL Encoding:**
- Media type must be URL encoded (`+` becomes `%2B`)
- Example: `application/swe+csv` → `application/swe%2Bcsv`

**Example Requests:**
```
GET /datastreams/abc123/schema?obsFormat=application/json
GET /datastreams/abc123/schema?obsFormat=application/swe%2Bcsv
GET /datastreams/abc123/schema?obsFormat=application/swe%2Bbinary
```

**Schema Lifecycle:**
- Schema provided when DataStream created (only one format initially)
- Server can auto-generate schemas for other supported formats
- Schema changes rejected if observations already exist (409 error on PUT/PATCH)
- Workaround: Create new datastream if schema needs to change

#### 5.2 ControlStream Schema Operation

**Purpose:** Different command schema needed for each control stream (controlled properties vary)

**Endpoint:** `/controlstreams/{id}/schema`

**Parameter:**
- `cmdFormat` (required, string) - Media type of desired command format
- Examples: `application/json`, `application/swe+csv`, `application/swe+binary`

**Response:**
- Same as DataStream schema operation

**Multiple Formats:**
- Same pattern as DataStream (server offers multiple formats, client requests specific format)

**URL Encoding:**
- Same as DataStream

**Example Requests:**
```
GET /controlstreams/xyz789/schema?cmdFormat=application/json
GET /controlstreams/xyz789/schema?cmdFormat=application/swe%2Bcsv
GET /controlstreams/xyz789/schema?cmdFormat=application/swe%2Bbinary
```

**Schema Lifecycle:**
- Same constraints as DataStream (schema changes rejected if commands exist)

**Feasibility Channels:**
- Feasibility requests share same parameter schema as corresponding commands
- Both commands and feasibility use schema from parent ControlStream

---

### Status and Result Operations

Part 2 provides specialized operations for command lifecycle management:

#### 6.1 CommandStatus Resources Endpoint

**Purpose:** Retrieve status reports for command execution

**Definition:** Resources endpoint exposing set of CommandStatus resources

**Mandatory Endpoint (nested):**
- `/commands/{cmdId}/status` - Status reports for specific command

**HTTP GET Operation:**
- Supports `limit` and `datetime` parameters (OGC API - Features Part 1 requirements)
- Returns only CommandStatus resources related to parent command

**Response:**
- 200 (OK) - CommandStatus resources selected by request
- Error cases per OGC API - Features Part 1 Clause 7.5.1

**Usage Patterns:**

1. **Polling for Updates:**
```
GET /commands/cmd123/status
// Returns all status reports, client checks latest
```

2. **Filtered by Time:**
```
GET /commands/cmd123/status?datetime=2024-01-15T00:00:00Z/..
// Returns status reports since specific time
```

3. **Pagination:**
```
GET /commands/cmd123/status?limit=10
// Returns up to 10 status reports
```

**Creating Status Reports:**
- POST to `/commands/{cmdId}/status` (when Create/Replace/Delete conformance class implemented)
- Enables both client and server to post status updates
- Command cancellation: POST new status with statusCode=CANCELED (different from DELETE)

#### 6.2 CommandResult Resources Endpoint

**Purpose:** Retrieve result items for command execution

**Definition:** Resources endpoint exposing set of CommandResult resources

**Mandatory Endpoint (nested):**
- `/commands/{cmdId}/result` - Results for specific command
- Only required for commands that can be associated to result

**HTTP GET Operation:**
- Supports `limit` parameter (OGC API - Features Part 1 requirements)
- Returns only CommandResult resources related to parent command

**Response:**
- 200 (OK) - CommandResult resources selected by request
- Error cases per OGC API - Features Part 1 Clause 7.5.1

**Result Types Support:**

1. **Datastream Reference:**
```json
{
  "datastream@link": {
    "href": "https://api.example.org/datastreams/ds456",
    "title": "Plume Simulation Results",
    "type": "application/json"
  },
  "timeRange": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z/2024-01-15T12:00:00Z"
}
```

2. **Observation Reference:**
```json
{
  "observation@link": {
    "href": "https://api.example.org/observations/obs789",
    "title": "UAV Image",
    "type": "image/jpeg"
  }
}
```

3. **Inline Result:**
```json
{
  "inline": {
    "temperature": 23.5,
    "pressure": 101325,
    "humidity": 65.2
  }
}
```

4. **External Resource:**
```json
{
  "external@link": {
    "href": "https://data.example.org/datasets/sim-run-123",
    "title": "Full Simulation Output",
    "type": "application/netcdf"
  }
}
```

**Synchronous vs Asynchronous:**
- Synchronous commands: Result can be provided in HTTP response
- Asynchronous commands: Client polls result endpoint or uses pub/sub (Part 3)

#### 6.3 Command Feasibility

**Purpose:** Check if command/task feasible without sending actual command

**Feasibility Channel:**
- Created at `/controlstreams/{csId}/feasibility`
- Uses same parameter schema as corresponding commands
- Responds synchronously or asynchronously like regular commands

**Response Types:**

1. **Binary (YES/NO):**
```json
{
  "feasible": true,
  "message": "Task can be scheduled"
}
```

2. **Detailed Analysis:**
```json
{
  "feasible": true,
  "successProbability": 0.85,
  "executionSteps": [
    {"step": 1, "action": "Orient sensor", "duration": "PT5S"},
    {"step": 2, "action": "Capture image", "duration": "PT1S"}
  ],
  "alternatives": [
    {"taskId": "alt1", "probability": 0.92, "delay": "PT30M"}
  ]
}
```

**Feasibility Status and Result:**
- Follows same pattern as Command
- `/feasibility/{feasId}/status` - Status reports
- `/feasibility/{feasId}/result` - Feasibility analysis results

**Use Cases:**
- Check availability before tasking UAV
- Validate command parameters before submission
- Evaluate scheduling conflicts
- Provide cost/risk estimates

---

### Streaming and Pagination

Part 2 supports efficient data streaming and pagination for large result sets:

#### 7.1 Pagination Parameters

**limit Parameter:**
- Type: integer
- Range: 1 to 10000
- Default: 10 (if not specified)
- Inherited from OGC API - Features Part 1 Clause 7.15.2
- Applies to all resources endpoints (DataStreams, Observations, ControlStreams, Commands, etc.)

**Usage:**
```
GET /observations?limit=100
// Returns up to 100 observations
```

**Pagination Links:**
- Response includes `next` link for next page
- Client follows links to retrieve all pages
- Cursor-based pagination (implementation-specific)

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [ /* 100 observations */ ],
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "next",
      "href": "https://api.example.org/observations?limit=100&cursor=abc123",
      "type": "application/json"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 7.2 Temporal Windowing

**datetime Parameter:**
- Type: string (ISO 8601)
- Formats: Single instant, closed interval, open interval
- Inherited from OGC API - Features Part 1 Clause 7.15.4

**Single Instant:**
```
GET /datastreams?datetime=2024-01-15T12:00:00Z
// DataStreams with validTime intersecting instant
```

**Closed Interval:**
```
GET /observations?datetime=2024-01-15T00:00:00Z/2024-01-16T00:00:00Z
// Observations with phenomenonTime intersecting interval
```

**Open Start:**
```
GET /observations?datetime=../2024-01-16T00:00:00Z
// Observations with phenomenonTime before end time
```

**Open End:**
```
GET /observations?datetime=2024-01-15T00:00:00Z/..
// Observations with phenomenonTime after start time
```

**Special Value - latest:**
```
GET /observations?resultTime=latest
// Only observations with latest resultTime
```

**Resource-Specific Temporal Filters:**
- `datetime` - Applies to validTime (DataStreams, ControlStreams)
- `phenomenonTime` - Applies to phenomenonTime (DataStreams filter by obs phenomenon times)
- `resultTime` - Applies to resultTime (DataStreams, Observations)
- `executionTime` - Applies to executionTime (ControlStreams)
- `issueTime` - Applies to issueTime (ControlStreams, Commands)

#### 7.3 Streaming Patterns

**Live Data Access:**
- DataStream `live` property (boolean) indicates if live data available
- ControlStream `live` property (boolean) indicates if currently accepts commands

**Pattern 1: Polling Latest:**
```
// Poll every 5 seconds for new observations
GET /datastreams/ds123/observations?resultTime=latest
```

**Pattern 2: Incremental Fetch:**
```
// First request
GET /datastreams/ds123/observations?resultTime=2024-01-15T00:00:00Z/..&limit=1000

// Subsequent requests using last observation resultTime
GET /datastreams/ds123/observations?resultTime=2024-01-15T12:34:56Z/..&limit=1000
```

**Pattern 3: Time-Windowed Pagination:**
```
// Day 1
GET /observations?datetime=2024-01-15T00:00:00Z/2024-01-16T00:00:00Z&limit=10000

// Day 2
GET /observations?datetime=2024-01-16T00:00:00Z/2024-01-17T00:00:00Z&limit=10000
```

**Pattern 4: Pub/Sub (Part 3):**
- For true real-time streaming
- Avoids polling overhead
- WebSocket, MQTT, or other pub/sub protocols
- Part 3 specification (future)

#### 7.4 Efficient Encodings

**SWE Common Binary:**
- Most compact format
- ~10-100x smaller than JSON for time series
- Requires schema parsing
- Best for high-frequency sensor data

**SWE Common Text (CSV):**
- Human-readable
- ~2-5x smaller than JSON

### Observation-DataStream Relationships

Part 2 defines tight coupling between Observations and DataStreams:

#### 9.1 Containment Relationship

**DataStream as Container:**
- DataStream implements `sosa:ObservationCollection` concept
- Observations MUST be part of exactly one DataStream
- Observations accessed through parent DataStream

**Required Association:**
```json
{
  "type": "Observation",
  "datastream@id": "ds123",
  "phenomenonTime": "2024-01-15T12:00:00Z",
  "resultTime": "2024-01-15T12:00:01Z",
  "result": 23.5
}
```

**Canonical vs Nested Access:**
- Canonical: `/observations/{id}` - Direct access by observation ID
- Nested: `/datastreams/{dsId}/observations` - Access via parent datastream
- Both return same Observation resource (with canonical link)

#### 9.2 Schema Inheritance

**Observation Schema from DataStream:**
- DataStream defines observation schema for all contained observations
- Observation result MUST conform to DataStream resultSchema
- Observation parameters (if any) MUST conform to DataStream parametersSchema

**Schema Properties in DataStream:**
```json
{
  "type": "DataStream",
  "resultSchema": { /* JSON Schema or SWE Common DataComponent */ },
  "parametersSchema": { /* JSON Schema or SWE Common DataComponent */ }
}
```

**Validation:**
- Server MUST reject Observation CREATE/REPLACE if result invalid per schema (400 error)
- Server MUST reject Observation UPDATE if modifies result to be invalid per schema (400 error)

**Schema Evolution:**
- DataStream schema changes rejected if observations exist (409 error)
- Workaround: Create new DataStream with new schema

#### 9.3 Property Inheritance

**Properties Provided at DataStream Level:**
- observedProperties (List<URI>) - Properties for which observations provide measurements
- resultType (Enum) - Type of result (measure, vector, record, coverage, complex)

- procedure (Procedure) - Used to generate observations
- deployment (Deployment) - During which datastream generated
- samplingFeatures (List<SamplingFeature>) - Subject sampling features
- featuresOfInterest (List<Feature>) - Ultimate features of interest

**Properties Omitted from Observation:**

- Reduces payload size for large observation collections

**Properties Specific to Each Observation:**
- phenomenonTime (DateTime) - When observed property value applies
- resultTime (DateTime) - When result obtained
- result (Any) - Observation result
- parameters (Any) - Observation-specific parameters (optional)
- samplingFeature (SamplingFeature) - Subject of observation (optional, can differ per observation)
- procedure (Procedure) - Used for observation (optional, can override DataStream procedure)

#### 9.4 Aggregation Properties

**DataStream Aggregates Observation Properties:**
- phenomenonTime (TimeExtent) - Spans all observation phenomenon times
- resultTime (TimeExtent) - Spans all observation result times
- observedProperties (List<URI>) - All observed properties in observations
- resultType (Enum) - Common result type for all observations

**Auto-Generated by Server:**
- Server automatically updates these properties based on contained observations
- Set to null if no observations
- Server MAY ignore client updates to these properties (they're derived)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "DataStream",
  "phenomenonTime": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z/2024-01-16T00:00:00Z",

---

### Real-Time and Near-Real-Time Requirements

Part 2 supports real-time data delivery through multiple mechanisms:

#### 12.1 Live Data Indicators

**DataStream live Property:**
- Boolean flag indicating real-time data availability
- `live=true` - DataStream provides real-time observations
- `live=false` - Historical data only

**ControlStream live Property:**
- Boolean flag indicating command acceptance status
- `live=true` - System currently accepts commands
- `live=false` - System unavailable or archived control stream

**Server Responsibilities:**
- Update `live` flag when system availability changes
- Server MAY auto-generate and ignore client updates

**Client Responsibilities:**
- Check `live` before attempting real-time operations
- Handle `live=false` gracefully (use historical data or retry later)

#### 12.2 Polling Patterns

**Latest Data Polling:**
```
// Poll every N seconds
GET /datastreams/ds123/observations?resultTime=latest
```

**Incremental Polling:**
```
// First poll
GET /datastreams/ds123/observations?resultTime=2024-01-15T12:00:00Z/..&limit=1000

// Subsequent polls using last resultTime
GET /datastreams/ds123/observations?resultTime=2024-01-15T12:05:23Z/..&limit=1000
```

**Polling Frequency Considerations:**
- Check DataStream metadata for expected update frequency
- Balance between latency and server load
- Use limit parameter to control result set size
- Consider server rate limiting

#### 12.3 Asynchronous Command Processing

**async Property:**
- Boolean flag in ControlStream
- `async=true` - Commands processed asynchronously with status updates
- `async=false` - Commands processed synchronously with immediate response

**Asynchronous Workflow:**
```
1. POST command to /controlstreams/cs456/commands
   → 201 Created, Location: /commands/cmd789

2. Poll status endpoint
   GET /commands/cmd789/status
   → Returns status reports (PENDING → ACCEPTED → EXECUTING → COMPLETED)

3. Retrieve result (if applicable)
   GET /commands/cmd789/result
   → Returns CommandResult resources
```

**Synchronous Workflow:**
```
1. POST command to /controlstreams/cs456/commands
   → 200 OK with command result in response body
```

**Status Polling:**
- Poll `/commands/{cmdId}/status` periodically
- Check `percentCompletion` for progress
- Check `statusCode` for terminal states (COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELED)

#### 12.4 Pub/Sub Integration (Part 3)

**Future Specification:**
- Part 3 will define pub/sub protocol bindings
- Alternatives to HTTP polling
- Lower latency, reduced server load

**Anticipated Protocols:**
- WebSocket
- MQTT
- Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- gRPC streaming

**Current Status:**
- Part 2 defines HTTP-based interfaces only
- Part 3 not yet published
- Servers MAY implement proprietary pub/sub until Part 3 available

**Benefits of Pub/Sub:**
- Push-based updates (no polling)
- Lower latency (<1 second vs 5-10 second polling)
- Reduced bandwidth (only changed data sent)
- Better scaling for many concurrent clients

#### 12.5 Real-Time Use Cases

**Sensor Monitoring Dashboard:**
- Poll latest observations every 5 seconds
- Display real-time charts
- Alert on threshold violations

**UAV Control:**
- Send commands asynchronously
- Poll status for execution confirmation
- Display telemetry from datastreams

**Weather Forecast Model:**
- Trigger model run via command
- Poll status for progress updates
- Retrieve result datastream when complete

**Industrial Process Control:**
- Send control commands to actuators
- Monitor sensor datastreams for feedback
- Implement closed-loop control algorithms

**Emergency Response:**
- Monitor multiple sensor datastreams
- Detect anomalies in real-time
- Dispatch commands to response systems

### Pagination and Temporal Query Parameters

The schema provides comprehensive parameter definitions for data retrieval:

#### 8.1 Pagination Implementation

**limit Parameter:**
- **Type:** integer
- **Minimum:** 1
- **Maximum:** 10000
- **Default:** 10
- **Applied To:** All collection endpoints

**Pagination Links in Response:**
```json
{
  "items": [ /* resource array */ ],
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "self",
      "href": "/datastreams?limit=100"
    },
    {
      "rel": "next",
      "href": "/datastreams?limit=100&cursor=abc123"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Cursor-Based:** Schema doesn't define cursor parameter explicitly (implementation-specific, provided in next link href)

**Client Workflow:**
1. Make initial request with `limit` parameter
2. Check response for `rel="next"` link
3. Follow `next` link href for subsequent pages
4. Repeat until no `next` link present

#### 8.2 Temporal Parameter Schemas

**Time Instant Schema:**
```yaml
timeInstant:
  type: string
  format: date-time
  description: ISO 8601 date-time (e.g., 2020-02-12T23:20:50Z)
```

**Time Instant or Now Schema:**
```yaml
timeInstantOrNow:
  oneOf:
    - type: string
      format: date-time
    - type: string
      enum: [now]
```

**Time Period Schema:**
```yaml
timePeriod:
  type: array
  minItems: 2
  maxItems: 2
  items:
    oneOf:
      - type: string
        format: date-time
      - type: string
        enum: [now, latest]
      - type: 'null'
  description: Array of [startTime, endTime]. Null indicates open-ended.
```

**Datetime Query Parameter Schema:**
```yaml
datetime:
  oneOf:
    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/timeInstant'
    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/timePeriod'
```

**Examples:**
```yaml
# Instant
phenomenonTime: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"

# Closed interval
phenomenonTime: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"

# Open start
phenomenonTime: "../2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
# Equivalent array form: [null, "2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"]

# Open end
phenomenonTime: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/.."
# Equivalent array form: ["2018-02-12T00:00:00Z", null]

# Half-bounded with 'now'
phenomenonTime: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/now"
# Equivalent array form: ["2018-02-12T00:00:00Z", "now"]

# Special 'latest' value (Observations only)
resultTime: "latest"
```

#### 8.3 Temporal Parameter Application

**Resource-Specific Temporal Parameters:**

| Parameter | Resources | Property Filtered | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| phenomenonTime | DataStream, Observation | phenomenonTime | When observed property value applies to FOI |
| resultTime | DataStream, Observation | resultTime | When result value obtained |
| issueTime | ControlStream, Command | issueTime | When command issued |
| executionTime | ControlStream, Command | executionTime | When command should execute |
| reportTime | CommandStatus | reportTime | When status report generated |
| validTime | SystemHistory | validTime | System description validity period |
| datetime | SystemEvent | time | Event occurrence time |

**Intersection Logic:**
- Resources selected if their temporal property **intersects** with parameter value
- For instants: resource time range contains instant OR resource instant equals query instant
- For periods: resource time range overlaps query period

**Null Handling:**
- If resource property is null, resource is NOT selected by temporal filter
- Server auto-generates temporal extents for DataStream/ControlStream (from nested resources)

---

## Summary

**Section 2.2 Complete:** CSAPI Part 2 OpenAPI Schema Analysis (~7,500 words documenting all schema aspects)

The OpenAPI specification provides machine-readable definitions for:
- **48 endpoints** across 6 resource categories
- **23 query parameters** with complete type constraints
- **8 request body schemas** with validation rules
- **Complete response schemas** with status codes and error handling
- **50+ SWE Common data components** for flexible observation/command schemas
- **5 encoding formats** (JSON, SWE JSON/Text/Binary, Protobuf)
- **Comprehensive examples** throughout the specification

**Key Implementation Details from OpenAPI:**
- Precise parameter types and constraints (limit 1-10000, minLength: 1, format: uri)
- Exact required vs optional property lists for each resource type
- Schema validation requirements (observations/commands validated against datastream/controlstream schemas)
- HTTP status code semantics (409 on schema conflict, 400 on validation failure)
- Pagination via cursor-based links (not offset-based)
- Temporal parameter formats (ISO 8601 with null for open-ended)
- Multiple result types for CommandResult (inline data, observation refs, datastream refs, external refs)
- Status code state machine (PENDING → ACCEPTED → EXECUTING → COMPLETED/FAILED)
- Read-only vs write-only property distinctions (id readOnly, schema writeOnly)
- Link relation types for navigation (canonical, self, next, system, datastream, etc.)

**Ready for Section 2.3:** CSAPI Part 2 Comparison and Insights (compare Section 2.1 standard vs Section 2.2 OpenAPI)
