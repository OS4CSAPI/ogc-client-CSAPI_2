4. **Over-engineering:** Unnecessary abstractions/complexity suggested

### Research Goals

This document synthesizes lessons learned to ensure this iteration:
- Right-sizes code volume
- Uses correct terminology
- Follows upstream patterns precisely
- Creates meaningful tests
- Justifies all architectural decisions

---

## 2. Previous Iterations Summary

### First Iteration: Homework Phase

**What we learned:**
- ogc-client architecture patterns
- PR #114 EDR implementation approach
- URL-building vs data-fetching distinction
- QueryBuilder pattern (though we called it "navigator")

**Problems:**
- Exploratory code, not production-ready
- No clear architecture plan
- Mixed patterns from multiple APIs
- Insufficient research before coding

**Value:**
- Hands-on learning
- Identified key challenges
- Built familiarity with codebase

### Second Iteration: Refined Implementation

**What we attempted:**
- ~90% feature complete (Phases 1-5)
- All 9 resource types implemented
- Format negotiation (GeoJSON, SensorML)
- Comprehensive test suite
- Draft PR #131 submitted

**Problems identified:**

1. **Code volume (~2x upstream):**
   - Total implementation + tests exceeded upstream size
   - Suggested over-engineering or unnecessary complexity
   - Raised maintainer concerns about proportionality

2. **Test quality ("too trivial"):**
   - Tests checked method existence, not behavior
   - Lacked real spec examples
   - Didn't validate complete URL structures
   - Edge cases not thoroughly tested

3. **Terminology confusion:**
   - Used "navigator" instead of "QueryBuilder"
   - Inconsistent with upstream naming
   - Created alignment issues

4. **Unknown architecture justification:**
   - Decisions made during implementation
   - No clear rationale documented
   - Hard to explain choices in PR review

**Outcome:**
- Draft PR not merged
- Need to address concerns before re-submission

---

## 3. What Worked Well

### Architecture Alignment

**Following PR #114 pattern:**
- ✅ URL building only (no data fetching)
- ✅ Per-collection factory method
- ✅ Caching of builder instances
- ✅ Conformance checking

**Evidence:** Core approach was correct, just over-built.

### Resource Coverage

**Implementing all 9 resources:**
- ✅ Systems, Deployments, Procedures, etc.
- ✅ Part 1 + Part 2 coverage
- ✅ Sub-resource support

**Evidence:** Scope was correct, CSAPI needs all resources.

### Format Support

**GeoJSON + SensorML:**
- ✅ Format negotiation via query params
- ✅ Multiple output formats

**Evidence:** Approach was valid (though may have been over-implemented).

### Integration Points

**Modifications to existing files:**
- ✅ endpoint.ts - add csapi() method
- ✅ info.ts - add conformance check
- ✅ index.ts - add exports

**Evidence:** Integration pattern was correct.

### Isolation

**CSAPI-specific code in own directory:**
- ✅ src/ogc-api/csapi/
- ✅ Minimal changes to existing files

**Evidence:** File organization was good.

## 4. What Was Over-Engineered

### Problem 1: Code Volume (~2x Upstream)

**What was over-engineered:**

1. **Format parsing/validation:**
   - Likely implemented SensorML parsers
   - Likely implemented SWE Common parsers
   - Likely implemented format validators
   - **Cost:** ~2000-4000 lines of format code

   **Should have been:**
   - URL building with format parameter only
   - No parsing (users handle responses)
   - **Cost:** ~10 lines (format constants)

2. **Excessive validation:**
   - Likely validated resource IDs
   - Likely validated parameter values
   - Likely validated format strings
   - **Cost:** ~70-80 lines (1 per method)

   **Should have been:**
   - Trust TypeScript types
   - Trust server validation
   - Only validate conformance + collection existence
   - **Cost:** ~1 line (conformance only)

3. **Type definitions for domain objects:**
   - Likely defined System, Deployment, Observation interfaces
   - Likely defined SensorML component types
   - Likely defined SWE Common data types
   - **Cost:** ~500-1000 lines of type definitions

   **Should have been:**
   - QueryOptions interface only
   - Users define their own domain types
   - **Cost:** ~50-100 lines (query options only)

4. **Helper utilities:**
   - Likely created shared utilities for CSAPI
   - Likely created abstraction layers
   - Likely created base classes
   - **Cost:** ~200-400 lines

   **Should have been:**
   - Minimal private helpers in builder class
   - No shared utilities
   - No abstraction layers
   - **Cost:** ~30 lines (2-3 helpers)

5. **Test bloat:**
   - Likely tested every combination
   - Likely created extensive fixtures
   - Likely tested trivial functionality
   - **Cost:** Inflated test LOC

   **Should have been:**
   - Meaningful tests with real spec examples
   - Focused on URL correctness
   - Test coverage quality over quantity

**Total over-engineering estimate:** ~3000-6000 lines that should be ~100-200 lines.

### Problem 2: Wrong Terminology

**What was wrong:**
- Called builder "navigator"
- Inconsistent with upstream (which uses "QueryBuilder")
- Created confusion in PR review

**Why it happened:**
- Misread upstream patterns
- First iteration exploration used wrong term
- Carried forward without correction

**Should have been:**
- Research terminology BEFORE coding
- Use exact upstream names
- Align all naming with established patterns

### Problem 3: Unnecessary Abstractions

**Likely over-abstractions:**

1. **Base classes for resources:**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ Likely did this
   abstract class ResourceBuilder {
     abstract resourceType: string;
     list(): string { ... }
     get(id: string): string { ... }
   }
   ```

   **Problems:**
   - No other API uses inheritance
   - Adds complexity
   - Harder to navigate

2. **Resource-specific navigators:**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ Likely did this
   class SystemsNavigator { ... }
   class DeploymentsNavigator { ... }
   // 9 separate classes
   ```

   **Problems:**
   - Code explosion (9x classes)
   - No upstream precedent
   - Over-engineered

3. **Shared utilities module:**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ Likely created this
   src/ogc-api/csapi/utils.ts  // Shared CSAPI utilities
   ```

   **Problems:**
   - Creates internal coupling
   - Not needed for simple URL building
   - Adds file count

**Should have been:**
- Single CSAPIQueryBuilder class
- Private helper methods, no abstraction
- No separate utility modules

---

## 5. What Was Under-Engineered

### Problem 1: Test Quality

**What was under-engineered:**

**Trivial tests:**
```typescript
// ❌ Previous approach (trivial)
it('should have getSystems method', () => {
  expect(typeof builder.getSystems).toBe('function');
});

it('should return string', () => {
  expect(typeof builder.getSystems()).toBe('string');
});
```

**Why insufficient:**
- Doesn't validate URL correctness
- Doesn't check query parameters
- Doesn't test spec compliance
- Doesn't catch real bugs

**Should have been:**
```typescript
// ✅ Better approach (meaningful)
it('should build systems URL with query parameters', () => {
  const url = builder.getSystems({
    bbox: [-180, -90, 180, 90],
    datetime: '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z/..',
    limit: 10
  });
  
  expect(url).toBe(
    'https://api.example.com/systems?' +
    'bbox=-180,-90,180,90&' +
    'datetime=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z/..&' +
    'limit=10'
  );
});

it('should properly encode special characters in parameters', () => {
  const url = builder.getSystem('sys-123/special?chars');
  expect(url).toContain('sys-123%2Fspecial%3Fchars');
});
```

### Problem 2: Documentation

**What was likely missing:**
- Clear architectural rationale
- Code volume justification
- Per-resource breakdown
- Comparison to EDR

**Should have been:**
- Comprehensive design research (like current approach)
- Code volume analysis upfront
- Architectural decision records
- PR description with full justification

### Problem 3: Incremental Planning

**What was likely missing:**
- Clear roadmap with phases
- Justification for each decision
- Pre-implementation research
- Architecture review before coding

**Should have been:**
- Research phase (Sections 1-12 complete BEFORE coding)
- Testing strategy defined upfront
- Architecture validated against upstream
- Incremental PR approach (Part 1 first?)

---

## 6. Maintenance Problems

### Problem 1: Unclear Responsibilities

**Likely issue:**
- Mixed concerns (URL building + validation + parsing)
- Unclear what library does vs user does
- Too much library functionality

**Impact:**
- Hard to maintain
- Hard to extend
- Hard to review

**Solution:**
- Clear separation: library builds URLs only
- User handles fetch, parsing, validation
- Minimal scope = easier maintenance

### Problem 2: Tight Coupling

**Likely issue:**
- CSAPI utilities coupled to shared code
- Format parsers coupled to CSAPI
- Resource classes coupled to each other

**Impact:**
- Changes ripple through codebase
- Hard to isolate bugs
- Merge conflict risk

**Solution:**
- Minimal imports (7 utilities)
- Duplicate simple helpers
- Strong isolation between resources

### Problem 3: Test Maintenance

**Likely issue:**
- Brittle tests (coupled to implementation)
- Incomplete coverage despite high LOC
- Hard to update when spec changes

**Impact:**
- Tests break on refactoring
- Low confidence in changes
- Test maintenance burden

**Solution:**
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Use real spec examples
- Focus on URL correctness

---

## 7. Testing Difficulties

### Problem 1: What to Test

**Previous confusion:**
- Should we test HTTP responses? (No - no fetch in library)
- Should we test parsing? (No - no parsing in library)
- Should we test validation? (Minimal - trust TypeScript)

**Clarity needed:**
- Test URL structure
- Test query parameter encoding
- Test spec compliance
- Test edge cases (null, undefined, empty)

### Problem 2: Test Quality Standards

**Previous approach:**
- High line count
- Low value per test
- "Too trivial" feedback

**Better approach:**
- Real spec examples
- Complete URL validation
- Edge case coverage
- Quality over quantity

### Problem 3: Test Organization

**Likely issue:**
- One test file per method?
- One test file per resource?
- Unclear organization

**Better approach:**
- url_builder.spec.ts - test builder class
- Resource-grouped tests
- Clear describe blocks
- Follow EDR test structure

---

## 8. Likely Rejection Points

### Rejection Point 1: Code Volume

**Why it matters:**
- ~2x upstream size overwhelming
