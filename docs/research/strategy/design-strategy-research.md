# Design Strategy Research

**Purpose:** Define the correct architectural approach for implementing CSAPI client support in ogc-client.

**Context:** Multiple previous iterations. Need to get design right BEFORE implementation to avoid wasted effort and PR rejection.

**Priority:** This research MUST be completed before writing any implementation code.

---

## Critical Question

**"What architecture will the maintainers accept and merge?"**

Everything else is secondary. This research answers that question definitively.

---

## ✅ CRITICAL TERMINOLOGY QUESTION (RESOLVED)

**Issue:** We've been using the term "navigator" throughout documentation and previous implementations (e.g., `CSAPINavigator`, `endpoint.csapi()` returns a "navigator"). However, this term may not be consistent with upstream terminology.

**RESOLUTION (from PR #114 analysis):**

The object returned by `endpoint.edr()` is called **`EDRQueryBuilder`** (not "navigator").

**Answers:**
- [x] What does PR #114 call the object returned by `endpoint.edr()`? → **`EDRQueryBuilder`**
- [x] Is "navigator" the correct upstream term? → **No, "QueryBuilder" is the pattern**
- [x] What's the actual class name in PR #114? → **`EDRQueryBuilder`**
- [x] What terminology should CSAPI use? → **`CSAPIQueryBuilder`**

**Confirmed Pattern:**
```typescript
// EDR implementation:
endpoint.edr() → returns EDRQueryBuilder

// CSAPI should follow:
endpoint.csapi() → returns CSAPIQueryBuilder
```

**Impact:** 
- Previous "navigator" terminology was incorrect
- CSAPI implementation must use "QueryBuilder" pattern
- Minimal documentation updates needed (terminology wasn't widely used in committed docs yet)

---

## ✅ CODE VOLUME CONCERN (RESOLVED)

**Issue:** Previous implementation was ~2x the size of entire upstream repo. This is a red flag for maintainers.

**RESOLUTION (from PR #114 analysis):**

**PR #114 Metrics:**
- **Total:** 2858 additions, 54 deletions
- **Implementation code:** ~750 lines (26%)
- **Test code:** ~2050 lines (72%)
- **Other:** ~58 lines (2%)
- **Files:** 18 total
- **Core modifications:** ~115 lines to existing files

**CSAPI Projection:**
- EDR has 5 query types, CSAPI has 9 resources
- Estimated **~3500 total lines** (~975 implementation, ~2450 tests, ~75 other)
- This is **~25% larger than EDR** (reasonable for 80% more resources)
- **NOT 2x the size of entire repo** - that was over-engineering in previous attempts

**Answers:**
- [x] How large is PR #114? → **2858 total lines, 750 implementation**
- [x] Typical size? → **~750 implementation per API family**
- [x] EDR resources vs CSAPI? → **5 query types vs 9 resources**
- [x] Code-per-resource ratio? → **~150 lines per resource for EDR**
- [x] Can we stay proportional? → **Yes, if we follow EDR patterns closely**

**Design Principle Confirmed:** Match PR #114's architecture exactly. Code volume will naturally align with upstream patterns.

### 6. ✅ File Organization Strategy (COMPLETED)

**Core functionality: How should CSAPI files be organized?**

**Analysis:** [docs/research/upstream/file-organization-analysis.md](../upstream/file-organization-analysis.md)

**Answers:**
- [x] What files go in `src/ogc-api/csapi/`? → **5 core files: model.ts, url_builder.ts, helpers.ts, + 2 test files** (Analysis Section 10)
- [x] Should there be subdirectories? → **No - flat structure like EDR (5 files doesn't need subdirs)** (Section 10)
- [x] How to organize 9 resource types? → **All in single model.ts file (~350-400 lines)** (Section 10)
- [x] Should each resource be a separate file? → **No - consolidate all resources in model.ts** (Section 2)
- [x] Where do format utilities go? → **helpers.ts for shared utilities** (Section 2)
- [x] Where do validators/parsers go? → **helpers.ts or inline in url_builder.ts** (Section 2)

**Analysis:** [docs/research/upstream/format-negotiation-analysis.md](../upstream/format-negotiation-analysis.md)

**Answers:**
- [x] Where does format negotiation logic live? → **Inline in url_builder.ts, no separate module** (Analysis Section 1)
- [x] How are Accept headers set? → **Not used - CSAPI uses query parameter instead** (Section 3)

### 9. Error Handling Design

**Questions to answer:**
- [ ] What errors should the library throw?
- [ ] What errors should be left to user?
- [ ] How to handle invalid parameters?
- [ ] How to handle non-CSAPI endpoints?
- [ ] How to handle missing resources?
- [ ] What's the error handling pattern upstream?
- [ ] Should there be custom error classes?

---

### 10. CSAPI-Specific Architectural Decisions

**Questions to answer:**
- [ ] How to handle 9 different resource types cleanly?
- [ ] Should resources share base implementation?
- [ ] How to model Part 1 vs Part 2 resources?
- [ ] How to handle sub-resources (systems/{id}/datastreams)?
- [ ] How to model observation/command schemas?

- [ ] What caused maintenance problems?
- [ ] What made testing difficult?
- [ ] What would maintainers likely reject?
- [ ] What feedback did we get (if any)?

**Action:** Review second iteration's architecture and identify improvements
