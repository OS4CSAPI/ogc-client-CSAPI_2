# 20: Gap Analysis from First Iteration

**Research Question:** What specific gaps in first implementation attempt relate to architecture decisions?

**Source Document:** [docs/research/requirements/csapi-gap-analysis.md](https://github.com/OS4CSAPI/ogc-client-CSAPI_2/blob/main/docs/research/requirements/csapi-gap-analysis.md)

**Decision Relevance:** HIGH - Identifies what was missing and why. May relate to architecture.

---

## Research Objectives

1. **Gap Identification:**
   - What was incomplete in first attempt?
   - Were gaps architectural or implementation?
   - How does format abstraction relate to architecture?

2. **Architecture Relationship:**
   - Did class structure contribute to gaps?
   - Would different organization have prevented gaps?
   - What completeness requirements affect architecture?

---

## Key Questions to Answer

- [ ] What were the identified gaps?
- [ ] Were gaps related to class organization?
- [ ] Did format handling issues relate to architecture?
- [ ] Would single vs multi-class affect gap patterns?
- [ ] What completeness requirements drive architecture?
- [ ] How does format abstraction tie to class structure?

---

## Expected Findings

Gaps likely related more to completeness than architecture, but may reveal organizational issues that contributed to incompleteness.

---

## Architecture Decision Impact

**HIGH IMPACT** - Understanding gaps helps ensure architecture supports completeness this time.
