# 05: OWSLib Class-Per-Resource Pattern

**Research Question:** How does OWSLib's mature, production-proven class-per-resource architecture compare to single-class approach?

**Source Document:** [docs/research/requirements/csapi-owslib-analysis.md](https://github.com/OS4CSAPI/ogc-client-CSAPI_2/blob/main/docs/research/requirements/csapi-owslib-analysis.md)

**Decision Relevance:** HIGH - OWSLib is the most mature CSAPI client library. Its patterns are proven in production.

---

## Research Objectives

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - Document OWSLib's class structure (SystemsClient, DeploymentsClient, etc.)
   - Identify code organization strategy
   - Analyze code reuse mechanisms

2. **Maturity Assessment:**
   - How long has OWSLib CSAPI been in production?
   - What issues has this pattern encountered?
   - How maintainable is the codebase?

3. **Comparison to Single-Class:**
   - What are advantages of separate classes?
   - What are disadvantages?
   - Code duplication levels?
   - Maintainability considerations?

4. **Applicability to TypeScript:**
   - Does Python's flexibility favor this pattern?
   - Would TypeScript benefit differently?
   - Language-specific considerations?

## Key Questions to Answer

- [ ] How many separate client classes does OWSLib have?
- [ ] How is code shared between client classes?
- [ ] What is the total LOC for all clients?
- [ ] Is there significant code duplication?
- [ ] How are common operations (CRUD) abstracted?
- [ ] What base class or mixin patterns are used?
- [ ] How maintainable is the separate-class approach?
- [ ] Are there documented issues with this pattern?

## Expected Findings

**If separate classes work well:**
- Proven production pattern
- Clear organization
- Manageable duplication
- May favor separate clients for CSAPI

**If pattern shows problems:**
- Code duplication issues
- Maintenance burden
- May favor single-class consolidation

---

## Architecture Decision Impact

**HIGH IMPACT** - OWSLib represents real-world success. If its pattern works well, we should consider it seriously.
