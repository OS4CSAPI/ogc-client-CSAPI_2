# 11: Integration Code Requirements

**Research Question:** How does class structure affect integration code complexity in endpoint.ts, info.ts, and index.ts?

**Source Document:** [docs/research/upstream/integration-analysis.md](https://github.com/OS4CSAPI/ogc-client-CSAPI_2/blob/main/docs/research/upstream/integration-analysis.md)

**Decision Relevance:** MEDIUM - Simpler integration may favor certain patterns over others.

---

## Research Objectives

1. **Integration Complexity:**
   - Lines of code required for single-class pattern
   - Lines of code if using multiple classes
   - File modification count

2. **Pattern Comparison:**
   - EDR integration approach (single class)
   - Hypothetical multi-class integration
   - Complexity differences

3. **Maintainability:**
   - Future maintenance implications
   - Code clarity and readability
   - Adding new resource types later

---

## Key Questions to Answer

- [x] How many lines needed for EDR (single QueryBuilder)?
- [x] How many lines for hypothetical multi-class approach?
- [x] What files must be modified in each case?
- [x] Does multi-class significantly increase integration complexity?
- [x] What is the diff size comparison?
- [x] Are there namespace/export implications?

---

## Expected Findings

**If single-class is simpler:**
- Lower integration LOC
- Fewer exports to manage
- Cleaner integration
- Favors consolidated approach

**If difference is minimal:**
- Integration complexity not a deciding factor
- Focus on other criteria
- Both approaches viable from integration perspective

---

## Architecture Decision Impact

**MEDIUM IMPACT** - Integration complexity matters for PR acceptance but may not be the primary driver.

## Synthesis Notes

Record key findings here for final synthesis document:

- **Single-class LOC:** 64 lines (35 endpoint.ts + 12 info.ts + 17 index.ts)
- **Multi-class LOC estimate:** 124-275 lines (2-class: 124-140, 9-class: 222-275)
- **Complexity difference:** Multi-class is 2-4.3x more complex than single-class
- **Files modified:** Same 3 files for all approaches (endpoint.ts, info.ts, index.ts)
- **Diff size:** Single-class has minimal 64-line diff vs 124-275 for multi-class
- **Maintainability:** Single-class requires 0 integration changes for new resources
- **User experience:** Single-class provides simple, intuitive API (`endpoint.csapi(id)`)
- **Testing:** Single-class requires 90 test lines vs 180-300 for multi-class
- **Namespace/exports:** Single-class has clean 17-line exports vs 35-80 for multi-class
- **Recommendation:** **Single-class pattern STRONGLY favored** - unambiguous winner from integration perspective

**Impact Level Revised:** HIGH (not MEDIUM) - Integration complexity is 2-4x different

**Confidence:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Quantitative measurements show clear advantage
