# 17: Part 1 Resource Scope and Complexity

**Research Question:** How does Part 1's scope (5 resource types, 70+ operations) inform architecture decisions?

**Source Document:** [docs/research/requirements/csapi-part1-requirements.md](https://github.com/OS4CSAPI/ogc-client-CSAPI_2/blob/main/docs/research/requirements/csapi-part1-requirements.md)

**Decision Relevance:** MEDIUM - Understanding Part 1 scope helps assess single-class feasibility.

---

## Research Objectives

1. **Scope Assessment:**
   - Count Part 1 resource types and operations
   - Analyze operation similarity across resources
   - Identify code reuse opportunities

2. **Scalability Analysis:**
   - Can single class handle 5 Part 1 resources?
   - How many methods total for Part 1?
   - Code organization challenges

---

## Key Questions to Answer

- [ ] How many unique operations across 5 Part 1 resources?
- [ ] How similar are CRUD patterns across resources?
- [ ] What is estimated method count for Part 1 alone?
- [ ] Would 5 separate classes be more manageable?
- [ ] What code reuse exists across Part 1 resources?

---

## Expected Findings

Part 1 alone may be manageable in single class, but combined with Part 2 may create bloat.

---

## Architecture Decision Impact

**MEDIUM IMPACT** - Part 1 + Part 2 combined scope drives feasibility of single-class pattern.
