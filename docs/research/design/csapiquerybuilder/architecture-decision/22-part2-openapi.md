# 22: Part 2 OpenAPI Structure Analysis

**Research Question:** What does Part 2 OpenAPI spec reveal about dynamic resource organization?

**Source Document:** [docs/research/standards/ogcapi-connectedsystems-2.bundled.oas31.yaml](https://github.com/OS4CSAPI/ogc-client-CSAPI_2/blob/main/docs/research/standards/ogcapi-connectedsystems-2.bundled.oas31.yaml)

**Decision Relevance:** MEDIUM - May reveal Part 2 as distinct enough to warrant separate organization.

---

## Research Objectives

1. **Part 2 Structure:**
   - How are Part 2 endpoints organized?
   - Relationship to Part 1 endpoints
   - Distinct characteristics of dynamic data resources

2. **Part 1/Part 2 Boundary:**
   - Is there a clear separation in spec?
   - Could this justify separate class organization?
   - Shared vs unique patterns

---

## Key Questions to Answer

- [ ] How distinct is Part 2 from Part 1 in spec organization?
- [ ] Are Part 2 resources clearly separate?
- [ ] Do Part 2 patterns differ significantly from Part 1?
- [ ] Would Part 1/Part 2 class split align with spec?
- [ ] What integration points exist between parts?

---

## Expected Findings

May reveal Part 2 as sufficiently distinct to justify separate organization, or show tight integration favoring unified class.

---

## Architecture Decision Impact

**MEDIUM IMPACT** - Could justify Part 1/Part 2 class separation if specs show clear boundary.
