# 06: OSHConnect-Python Stateful Builder Pattern

**Research Question:** How does OSHConnect-Python's builder pattern and stateful approach inform architecture decisions?

**Source Document:** [docs/research/requirements/csapi-oshconnect-python-analysis.md](https://github.com/OS4CSAPI/ogc-client-CSAPI_2/blob/main/docs/research/requirements/csapi-oshconnect-python-analysis.md)

**Decision Relevance:** MEDIUM - Shows alternative pattern (builder + stateful), provides comparison point.

---

## Research Objectives

1. **Pattern Understanding:**
   - Document builder pattern implementation
   - Understand stateful vs stateless approach
   - Analyze query construction methods

2. **Comparison Analysis:**
   - How does builder pattern differ from QueryBuilder?
   - Stateful vs stateless trade-offs
   - Applicability to ogc-client patterns

3. **Class Organization:**
   - Does OSHConnect use separate builders per resource?
   - How are resources organized?
   - Code reuse strategies?

---

## Key Questions to Answer

- [ ] How many builder classes does OSHConnect have?
- [ ] Is there one builder per resource or consolidated?
- [ ] What state does builder maintain?
- [ ] How is method chaining implemented?
- [ ] Are there separate classes per resource?
- [ ] What is code organization strategy?
- [ ] How does this pattern scale to 9 resources?

---

## Expected Findings

**If uses multiple builders:**
- Precedent for separate-class approach
- Shows how to organize 9 resource types
- May inform CSAPI structure

**If uses single builder:**
- Another example of consolidation
- Validates single-class approach
- Less relevant for decision

---

## Architecture Decision Impact

**MEDIUM IMPACT** - Provides alternative pattern perspective but may not align with ogc-client conventions.
