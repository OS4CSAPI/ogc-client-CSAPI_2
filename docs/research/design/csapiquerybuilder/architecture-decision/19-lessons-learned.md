# 19: Lessons from Previous Implementation Attempts

**Research Question:** What architectural lessons from previous iterations inform the single-class vs multi-class decision?

**Source Document:** [docs/research/requirements/lessons-learned-analysis.md](https://github.com/OS4CSAPI/ogc-client-CSAPI_2/blob/main/docs/research/requirements/lessons-learned-analysis.md)

**Decision Relevance:** HIGH - Past failures and successes should guide architecture decisions.

---

## Research Objectives

1. **Failure Analysis:**
   - What architectural choices led to rejection?
   - Over-engineering vs under-engineering
   - Code organization issues

2. **Success Patterns:**
   - What worked well in previous attempts?
   - What was praised by reviewers?
   - What should be preserved?

3. **Applicable Lessons:**
   - Do lessons favor single-class or multi-class?
   - What mistakes must be avoided?
   - What principles should guide decision?

## Key Questions to Answer

- [ ] Was architecture a factor in previous rejections?
- [ ] What organizational issues were noted?
- [ ] Was code too fragmented or too monolithic?
- [ ] What architectural feedback was received?
- [ ] What patterns worked well?
- [ ] What must be avoided this time?

---

## Expected Findings

**Critical insights from failures:**
- Patterns that led to rejection
- Architectural red flags
- Success criteria

**Should heavily influence current decision.**

---

## Architecture Decision Impact

**HIGH IMPACT** - Learning from failures is critical to success this time.
