# 14: Usage Scenario Analysis

**Research Question:** What common usage scenarios favor single-class vs multi-class organization?

**Source Document:** [docs/research/requirements/csapi-usage-scenarios.md](https://github.com/OS4CSAPI/ogc-client-CSAPI_2/blob/main/docs/research/requirements/csapi-usage-scenarios.md)

**Decision Relevance:** MEDIUM - Real usage patterns should inform API design.

---

## Research Objectives

1. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - Review 15 core usage scenarios
   - Identify multi-resource workflows
   - Note single-resource focused operations

2. **API Convenience:**
   - Which pattern provides better API for common scenarios?
   - Method discoverability considerations
   - Workflow optimization

3. **Pattern Fitness:**
   - Does single class handle all scenarios well?
   - Would separate classes improve any scenarios?
   - Trade-off analysis

---

## Key Questions to Answer

- [x] How many scenarios involve multiple resource types?
- [x] How many focus on single resource types?
- [x] Are cross-resource navigation patterns common?
- [x] Would separate classes improve scenario code?
- [x] Does single class create method bloat affecting usability?
- [x] What convenience methods span multiple resources?

---

## Expected Findings

**If scenarios favor single class:**
- Multi-resource workflows are common
- Unified API improves usability
- Consolidation benefits users

**If scenarios favor separate classes:**
- Resource-specific operations dominate
- Clear separation improves clarity
- Separate clients more intuitive

---

## Architecture Decision Impact

**MEDIUM IMPACT** - User experience should drive API design, but must work within pattern constraints.

## Synthesis Notes

Record key findings here for final synthesis document:

**Multi-resource scenarios:** 15/15 (100%)
- All scenarios require 2-9 resource types
- Average 3.4 resources per scenario
- Dashboard monitoring uses 9 resource types (most complex)
- Simplest scenario (track history) still uses 2 resource types

**Single-resource scenarios:** 0/15 (0%)
- ZERO scenarios work with single resource type in isolation
- Even "list systems" typically proceeds to access datastreams/observations

**Pattern suitability:** Single-class STRONGLY favored
- Single-class: Excellent fit for 15/15 scenarios (100%)
- Multi-class: Poor fit for 15/15 scenarios (100%)
- Single-class reduces user code by ~40%
- Multi-class creates API fragmentation requiring 3-9 builder classes

**User experience assessment:**
- Single-class: 1 import, 1 object, all methods visible in IntelliSense
- Multi-class: 3-9 imports, 3-9 objects, fragmented API surface
- Single-class enables 17 convenience methods
- Multi-class prevents most convenience methods (ambiguous placement)
- Method bloat NOT a concern: Clear naming + IntelliSense = excellent discoverability

**Cross-resource navigation patterns:**
- Required in 100% of workflows
- Every resource has 2-6 relationship types
- Navigation is core CSAPI pattern (not exception)
- Single-class provides seamless relationship traversal
- Multi-class fragments navigation across multiple builders

**Essential workflows analysis:**
- All 6 workflows navigate 2-9 resource types
- Average 3.5 builder classes needed with multi-class approach
- Real-time monitoring: 3 resources (Systems → Datastreams → Observations)
- Command and control: 4 resources (Systems → ControlStreams → Commands → Status)
- Deployment tracking: 5 resources (most complex workflow)

**Confidence:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Overwhelming evidence for single-class
