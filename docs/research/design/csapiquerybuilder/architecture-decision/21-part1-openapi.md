# 21: Part 1 OpenAPI Structure Analysis

**Research Question:** What does Part 1 OpenAPI spec reveal about endpoint organization that informs class structure?

**Source Document:** [docs/research/standards/ogcapi-connectedsystems-1.bundled.oas31.yaml](https://github.com/OS4CSAPI/ogc-client-CSAPI_2/blob/main/docs/research/standards/ogcapi-connectedsystems-1.bundled.oas31.yaml)

**Decision Relevance:** MEDIUM - API structure may suggest natural organization boundaries.

---

## Research Objectives

1. **Endpoint Organization:**
   - How are Part 1 endpoints grouped in spec?
   - Are resources clearly separated?
   - What operation tags are used?

2. **Natural Boundaries:**
   - Does API structure suggest separate resource organization?
   - Are resources tightly coupled or independent?
   - What shared operations exist?

---

## Key Questions to Answer

- [ ] How are endpoints grouped in OpenAPI spec?
- [ ] What operation tags exist (Systems, Deployments, etc.)?
- [ ] Are resources independent or tightly coupled?
- [ ] Does spec suggest single unified API or separate resources?
- [ ] What shared schemas exist across resources?

---

## Expected Findings

OpenAPI organization may reveal whether spec authors viewed resources as unified or separate concepts.

---

## Architecture Decision Impact

**MEDIUM IMPACT** - API design philosophy may inform our class organization.
