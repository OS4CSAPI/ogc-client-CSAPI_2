# Section 01: Upstream Blueprint Analysis (PR #114) - Research Plan

**Status:** Complete ✅  
**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026  
**Estimated Research Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Actual Research Time:** 3.5 hours  
**Estimated Test Implementation Lines:** N/A (Research produces analysis document, not tests)

## 1. Research Objective

Extract the complete testing blueprint from the accepted EDR implementation (PR #114 - camptocamp/ogc-client#114). Document all test patterns, structures, assertions, fixtures, and quality indicators that define what upstream maintainers accept as "meaningful" tests.

**Why 1st:** PR #114 is the **most recent accepted implementation** that follows the same pattern CSAPI will use (factory method + QueryBuilder + conformance detection). EDR was merged by upstream maintainers, so their test strategy is proven and accepted. Everything else in our testing strategy validates against this blueprint.

**Critical Constraint:** Our tests were previously rejected as "not meaningful, useful, deep, or end-to-end." PR #114 shows us what IS accepted.

## 10. Notes and Open Questions

<!-- Add notes and unresolved questions here as research progresses -->

**Initial Observations:**
- PR #114 is the most recent merged implementation following the same pattern CSAPI will use
- Previous CSAPI tests were rejected as "not meaningful" - PR #114 shows what IS acceptable
- EDR has fewer resource types than CSAPI, may need pattern scaling

**Risks and Mitigation:**

**Risk:** PR #114 may not have comprehensive test coverage  
**Mitigation:** Cross-reference with Section 2 (other implementations) to identify any EDR gaps

**Risk:** EDR tests may be simpler than CSAPI needs (EDR has fewer resource types)  
**Mitigation:** Document where CSAPI complexity exceeds EDR and plan adaptations in deliverable Section 11

**Risk:** Coverage reports may not be available in PR artifacts  
**Mitigation:** Use current repository coverage tools to measure EDR tests retrospectively

**Risk:** Test patterns may be implicit rather than documented  
**Mitigation:** Extract patterns through direct code analysis, not relying on PR description alone

**Next Steps After Completion:**
1. Use EDR blueprint to validate Section 2 findings (upstream consistency)
2. Compare EDR patterns against Section 3 industry standards
3. Apply EDR patterns to Section 12 (QueryBuilder testing strategy)
4. Use as validation criteria for Section 36 (Test Quality Checklist)
