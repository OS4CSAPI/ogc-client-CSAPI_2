# Research Plan: Roadmap Testing Integration Strategy

**Section:** 5 of 38  
**Phase:** 2 - Architecture Integration  
**Status:** Research Planning Phase - Not Started  
**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026  
**Estimated Research Time:** 1 hour  
**Estimated Test Implementation Lines:** N/A (this defines when to write tests across 34 Roadmap tasks)

---

## 1. Research Objective

Understand how the 34-task incremental Roadmap structures testing with the "test immediately after each subtask" pattern. Define when to write what tests, how to organize tests incrementally, and how to prevent test debt accumulation across 4 phases.

**Why This Research Fifth:**

The Roadmap specifies "write tests immediately after each subtask" as a core principle to prevent test debt. After validating Implementation Guide requirements (Section 4), understand how those requirements distribute across 34 incremental tasks. This defines:
- **When** to write tests (after which subtasks)
- **What** to test at each checkpoint
- **How** to organize tests incrementally
- **How** to prevent test debt with incremental development
- **How** to commit tests (per subtask vs per phase)

**Sequencing Rationale:**
Must follow Section 4 (Implementation Guide validation) to ensure Roadmap test estimates align with validated requirements. Defines incremental workflow for all subsequent implementation sections.

## 10. Notes and Open Questions

<!-- Add notes and unresolved questions here as research progresses -->

**Initial Observations:**
- Roadmap's 34-task structure provides natural test checkpoints
- "Test immediately" pattern prevents test debt accumulation
- Phase 3 restructuring (15 subtasks) specifically designed to prevent large test debt
- Phase 4 includes 2 pure testing tasks (Tasks 2-3)

**Risks and Mitigation:**

**Risk:** Incremental testing may slow development velocity  
**Mitigation:** Document efficiency gains from preventing test debt; validate pattern worked in upstream library development; show cost of accumulated test debt vs incremental testing

**Risk:** Test organization may become unwieldy with 9 resource types  
**Mitigation:** Define clear organization strategy upfront; use consistent patterns; leverage test utilities; prevent duplication through shared fixtures

**Risk:** Commit strategy may conflict with PR review preferences  
**Mitigation:** Document flexibility; allow squashing later if needed for PR cleanup; emphasize granular commits aid debugging

**Risk:** Coverage targets may be optimistic for incremental development  
**Mitigation:** Set realistic phase targets; allow flexibility; track actual coverage vs targets; adjust if needed

**Workflow Validation:**
- All 34 tasks have test specifications
- Test estimates align with Implementation Guide
- Incremental pattern prevents test debt (validated by max time/lines thresholds)
- Organization strategy is practical for 9 resource types + 15 parser subtasks
- Commit strategy is Git-friendly
- Workflow guide is implementation-ready

**Next Steps After Completion:**
1. Use workflow guide during implementation (reference during development)
2. Track actual test lines vs estimates during development
3. Adjust estimates if reality differs from plan
4. Use as template for commit messages
5. Reference for all "when to test" questions during development
