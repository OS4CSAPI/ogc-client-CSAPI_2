## 1. Research Objective

Define consistent testing pattern for resource methods (CRUD operations) that can be applied systematically across all 9 CSAPI resource types. Create reusable template that ensures uniform test coverage and quality.

### Why This Research Thirteenth

**Dependency Chain:** After QueryBuilder URL construction testing (Section 12), define testing for the resource operations that use those URLs.

**Consistency Need:** With 9 resource types (Systems, Deployments, Procedures, SamplingFeatures, Properties, DataStreams, Observations, ControlStreams, Commands), need consistent testing approach to:
- **Avoid duplication:** Don't write same tests 9 times - create reusable template
- **Ensure completeness:** All resource types get equal coverage (GET collection/item, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- **Maintain quality:** Uniform "meaningful" test depth across all resource types
- **Enable reuse:** Template/pattern that scales as new resource types are added

This research defines:
- **CRUD Pattern:** Consistent testing for Create, Read, Update, Delete operations applicable to all 9 resource types
- **Query Pattern:** Consistent testing for collection queries with pagination, filtering, temporal/spatial parameters
- **Template:** Reusable test structure (describe blocks, test utilities, assertions) applicable to all resource types
- **Differentiation:** What's unique per resource type (systemType for Systems, phenomenonTime for Observations) vs shared (limit, offset, bbox)
- **Test Depth:** What constitutes "meaningful" resource method testing (URL validation, query parameter encoding, error conditions)

### Sequencing Rationale

- **Position 13:** After QueryBuilder testing strategy (Section 12) establishes how URLs are constructed, now define the consistent pattern for testing those methods across all resource types
- **Before Section 14:** Integration workflows require resource methods, this establishes the testing pattern
- **Template Focus:** Emphasizes consistency and reusability across 9 resource types to avoid duplication and ensure quality
- **Integration with Section 12:** Resource method tests ARE QueryBuilder tests - this section defines the pattern, Section 12 defines the implementation

## 7. Deliverable

**Document Location:** `docs/deliverables/testing/resource-method-testing-template.md`

**Required Sections:**

### 1. Executive Summary
- Universal CRUD pattern across 9 resource types
- Consistent test structure and depth
- Reusable template with resource-specific extensions
- Estimated test lines per resource type (140-228 lines)
- Test organization strategy (part of QueryBuilder tests from Section 12)

### 2. CRUD Operations Matrix
- Table: 9 resource types × 6 operations (GET collection, GET item, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- All operations supported across all resource types
- Priority per resource type (CRITICAL: Systems, DataStreams, Observations; HIGH: Deployments, SamplingFeatures, Properties; MEDIUM: Procedures, ControlStreams, Commands)

### 3. Universal Test Template
- Complete TypeScript template with describe block structure
- Apply to each resource type by replacing placeholders
- Covers: GET collection (no params, pagination, filtering), GET item (valid ID, encoding), POST create, PUT update, PATCH update, DELETE, error handling

### 5. Query Parameter Testing Checklist
- Universal parameters table: limit, offset, bbox (all resource types)
- Resource-specific parameters table: per resource type with test scenarios

### 6. Test Depth Definition
- "Meaningful" characteristics: Use parseAndValidateUrl, validate complete URL structure, test query parameters systematically, test resource-specific parameters, test encoding, test error conditions, use realistic fixtures
- "Trivial" to avoid: Just check url.includes(), skip query parameter validation, skip resource-specific tests, skip encoding, skip error conditions

### 7. Test Organization
- **Recommendation:** Resource method tests are part of QueryBuilder tests (Section 12 multi-file organization)
- Not separate files - methods are thin wrappers around QueryBuilder
- This section defines the pattern, Section 12 defines the implementation

### 8. Fixture Requirements
- Directory: fixtures/csapi-resource-methods/
- Universal fixtures: conformance-all-resources.json, collections-info.json
- Resource-specific fixtures: 2 per resource type (collection response, item response) = 18 fixtures
- Error fixtures: 404-not-found.json, 400-bad-request.json, 409-conflict.json
- **Total: ~25 fixtures**

### 9. Testing Estimates per Resource Type
- Table per resource type: Base Tests (Template), Resource-Specific Tests, Total Tests, Lines per Test, Total Lines, Time Estimate
- **Grand Total: 139 tests, 1,390-1,668 lines, 19-23 hours**
- **Note:** These estimates overlap with Section 12 QueryBuilder testing

### 10. Testing Priorities
- **CRITICAL:** GET collection with pagination (all 9), GET item (all 9), resource-specific query parameters (Systems, Deployments, Observations)
- **HIGH:** GET collection with all query parameters, POST/PUT/PATCH methods, encoding tests, error conditions
- **MEDIUM:** DELETE methods, advanced query parameter combinations, edge case encoding
- **LOW:** Performance testing, very large result sets

### 11. Validation Against Upstream Patterns
- Compare with Section 1-2 findings
- Assertion pattern alignment
- Test depth alignment
- Quality standards alignment

### 12. Integration with Implementation Guide
- Cross-validate with Implementation Guide resource method specifications
- Document alignment (✅), gaps (⚠️), conflicts (❌)

### 13. Application Guide

  1. Copy template describe block structure
  2. Replace `ResourceType` with actual resource type name
  3. Replace `resourcetypes` with actual path segment
  4. Add resource-specific query parameter tests
  5. Add resource-specific error condition tests
  6. Create 2 fixtures (collection response, item response)

## 8. Dependencies

**Must Complete Before Starting:**
- Section 12: QueryBuilder Testing Strategy (resource methods use QueryBuilder to construct URLs)
- Section 8: CSAPI Specification Test Requirements (resource operation specs from Part 1 & 2)
- Section 6: "Meaningful vs Trivial" Definition (test depth guidance)
- Section 1-2: Upstream Resource Method Test Patterns
- CRUD Operations Requirements: [docs/research/requirements/csapi-crud-operations.md](../../requirements/csapi-crud-operations.md)

**This Section Blocks:**
- Section 14: Integration Test Workflows (uses resource methods for discovery, observation retrieval, command workflows)
- Section 15: Fixture Sourcing Strategy (resource method fixtures)
- Section 36: Test Quality Checklist (resource method test validation criteria)

**Note:** This section provides the PATTERN/TEMPLATE. Section 12 provides the detailed implementation plan. These two sections together define complete QueryBuilder + resource method testing.

---

## 9. Research Status Checklist

- [ ] **Phase 1 Complete:** CRUD operations analysis (matrix of 9 resource types × 6 operations, common patterns identified)
- [ ] **Phase 2 Complete:** Upstream resource method analysis (test patterns, assertion styles, utilities)
- [ ] **Phase 3 Complete:** Template design (universal describe block structure, shared utilities, fixture organization)
- [ ] **Phase 4 Complete:** Resource-specific differentiation (unique parameters per type, extension approach, application guide)

---

## 10. Notes and Open Questions

**Template Design Philosophy:**
- **Reusability First:** Template must work for all 9 resource types with minimal modification
- **Consistency:** All resource types get equal test coverage (12 base tests minimum)
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add resource-specific tests without breaking template structure
- **Maintainability:** Clear placeholders, well-documented application process

**Integration with Section 12:**
- Resource method tests ARE QueryBuilder tests - not separate
- This section (13) defines the pattern/template
- Section 12 defines the implementation details (multi-file organization, fixtures, utilities)
- Together they provide complete testing strategy for ~70-80 methods

**Resource-Specific Variations:**
- **Systems (5 additional tests):** systemType vocabulary, parent reference, nested resources (datastreams, deployments)
- **Deployments (3 additional tests):** validTime temporal filter (required), platform reference
- **Observations (7 additional tests):** Most complex - datastream reference, phenomenonTime, resultTime, multiple temporal filters
- **Others (2-4 additional tests):** Various query parameters, vocabularies, references

**Fixture Strategy:**
- Universal fixtures shared across all resource types (conformance, collections)
- Resource-specific fixtures (2 per type: collection, item) for realistic testing
- Error fixtures shared (404, 400, 409)
- Total: ~25 fixtures (manageable)

**Test Organization:**
- Recommendation: Resource method tests integrated into QueryBuilder test files (from Section 12)
- Alternative: Separate files only if methods have significant logic beyond URL building (not expected)
- Shared utilities critical: parseAndValidateUrl, validateQueryParams, validateEncoding (from Section 12)

**Risks and Mitigation:**
- **Risk:** Template doesn't fit all resource types equally well → **Mitigation:** Design flexible template, document variations, allow extensions
- **Risk:** Resource-specific variations not comprehensive → **Mitigation:** Thorough analysis of all 9 resource types, checklist approach
- **Risk:** Template becomes maintenance burden → **Mitigation:** Keep template simple, focus on reusability, document clearly
- **Risk:** Test duplication across resource types → **Mitigation:** Maximize shared utilities, consider parametrized tests

**Next Steps After Completion:**
1. Apply template to all 9 resource types (Phase 2, Tasks 2-10)
2. Create shared test utilities (parseAndValidateUrl from Section 12)
3. Create universal fixtures (conformance, collections)
4. Create resource-specific fixtures (2 per type, 18 total)
5. Validate template against first implementation (Systems)
6. Iterate template based on learnings from first implementation
  
  // ====================
  // DELETE TESTS
  // ====================
  describe('deleteResourceType(id)', () => {
    it('should build delete URL', () => {
      const url = builder.deleteResourceType('resource-123');
      validateUrl(url, {
        pathname: '/collections/collection-id/resourcetypes/resource-123',
        query: {}
      });
    });
  });
  
  // ====================
  // ERROR HANDLING
  // ====================
  describe('Error Conditions', () => {
    it('should handle missing ID for item operations', () => {
      expect(() => builder.getResourceType('')).toThrow();
    });
    
    // Resource-specific error conditions
  });
});
```

#### 4. Resource-Specific Variations

**Systems Resource Additions:**

```typescript
// Add to getResourceTypes() describe block:
it('should build collection URL with systemType filter', () => {
  const url = builder.getSystems({ systemType: 'sensor' });
  validateUrl(url, {
    pathname: '/collections/collection-id/systems',
    query: { systemType: 'sensor' }
  });
});

it('should build collection URL with parent filter', () => {
  const url = builder.getSystems({ parent: 'parent-system-id' });
  validateUrl(url, {
    pathname: '/collections/collection-id/systems',
    query: { parent: 'parent-system-id' }
  });
});
```

**Deployments Resource Additions:**

```typescript
// Add to getResourceTypes() describe block:
it('should build collection URL with validTime filter', () => {
  const url = builder.getDeployments({ 
    validTime: '2024-01-01/2024-12-31' 
  });
  validateUrl(url, {
    pathname: '/collections/collection-id/deployments',
    query: { validTime: '2024-01-01/2024-12-31' }
  });
});
```

**Observations Resource Additions:**

```typescript
// Add to getResourceTypes() describe block:
it('should build collection URL with phenomenonTime filter', () => {
  const url = builder.getObservations({ 
    phenomenonTime: '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z/2024-01-31T23:59:59Z' 
  });
  validateUrl(url, {
    pathname: '/collections/collection-id/observations',
    query: { phenomenonTime: '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z/2024-01-31T23:59:59Z' }
  });
});

it('should build collection URL with resultTime filter', () => {
  const url = builder.getObservations({ 
    resultTime: '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z' 
  });
  validateUrl(url, {
    pathname: '/collections/collection-id/observations',
    query: { resultTime: '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z' }
  });
});

it('should build collection URL with datastream filter', () => {
  const url = builder.getObservations({ 
    datastream: 'datastream-123' 
  });
  validateUrl(url, {
    pathname: '/collections/collection-id/observations',
    query: { datastream: 'datastream-123' }
  });
});
```

#### 5. Query Parameter Testing Checklist

**Universal Parameters (All Resource Types):**

```markdown
| Parameter | Test Scenarios | Priority |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| limit | Valid value (10), zero, very large (1000), negative (should error) | HIGH |
| offset | Valid value (20), zero, very large, negative (should error) | HIGH |
| bbox | Valid bbox, invalid bbox (wrong format), edge cases (crossing antimeridian) | MEDIUM |
```

**Resource-Specific Parameters:**

```markdown
| Resource Type | Unique Parameters | Test Scenarios |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Systems | systemType, parent | Valid types, invalid type, missing |
| Deployments | validTime, platform | Valid interval, open intervals, invalid format |
| Procedures | procedureType | Valid type, invalid type |
| SamplingFeatures | samplingFeatureType, sampledFeature | Valid type, invalid type, URI validation |
| Properties | observableProperty | Valid URI, invalid URI |
| DataStreams | observedProperty, phenomenonTime | URI validation, temporal validation |
| Observations | datastream, phenomenonTime, resultTime | ID validation, temporal validation |
| ControlStreams | systemId | Valid ID, invalid ID |
| Commands | controlstream, executionTime | ID validation, temporal validation |
```

#### 6. Test Depth Definition

**"Meaningful" Resource Method Test Characteristics:**

✅ **DO:**
- Use parseAndValidateUrl utility (from Section 12)
- Validate complete URL structure (protocol, host, path, query)
- Test query parameters systematically (presence, encoding, combinations)
- Test resource-specific parameters thoroughly
- Test encoding of special characters
- Test error conditions (missing ID, invalid parameters)
- Use realistic fixtures when available

❌ **DON'T (Trivial):**
- Just check `url.includes('/resourcetype')`
- Skip query parameter validation
- Skip resource-specific parameter tests
- Skip encoding tests
- Skip error conditions
- Use overly simple fixtures

#### 7. Test Organization

**Option 1: Combined Resource Method Tests (within QueryBuilder test files)**
- Already covered in Section 12 (multi-file organization per resource type)
- Resource method tests are part of QueryBuilder tests

**Option 2: Separate Resource Method Test Files (if distinct from QueryBuilder)**
- Only if resource methods have significant logic beyond URL building
- Not recommended if methods are thin wrappers around QueryBuilder

**Recommendation:** Resource method tests are part of QueryBuilder tests (Section 12). This section defines the consistent pattern to apply.

#### 8. Fixture Requirements

```markdown
Fixture Directory: `fixtures/csapi-resource-methods/`

Universal Fixtures:
- conformance-all-resources.json (used by all)
- collections-info.json (used by all)

Resource-Specific Fixtures (per resource type):
- systems-collection-response.json
- systems-item-response.json
- deployments-collection-response.json
- deployments-item-response.json
- (etc. for all 9 resource types)

Error Fixtures:
- 404-not-found.json
- 400-bad-request.json
- 409-conflict.json

Total: ~25 fixtures (2 per resource type + 5 universal)
```

#### 9. Testing Estimates per Resource Type

```markdown
| Resource Type | Base Tests (Template) | Resource-Specific Tests | Total Tests | Lines per Test | Total Lines | Time Estimate |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Systems | 12 | 5 | 17 | 10-12 | 170-204 | 2-3 hours |
| Deployments | 12 | 3 | 15 | 10-12 | 150-180 | 2 hours |
| Procedures | 12 | 2 | 14 | 10-12 | 140-168 | 2 hours |
| SamplingFeatures | 12 | 3 | 15 | 10-12 | 150-180 | 2 hours |
| Properties | 12 | 2 | 14 | 10-12 | 140-168 | 2 hours |
| DataStreams | 12 | 4 | 16 | 10-12 | 160-192 | 2-3 hours |
| Observations | 12 | 7 | 19 | 10-12 | 190-228 | 3 hours |
| ControlStreams | 12 | 2 | 14 | 10-12 | 140-168 | 2 hours |
| Commands | 12 | 3 | 15 | 10-12 | 150-180 | 2 hours |
| **TOTAL** | **108** | **31** | **139** | **~11 avg** | **1,390-1,668** | **19-23 hours** |
```

**Note:** These estimates overlap with Section 12 QueryBuilder testing. Resource method tests ARE QueryBuilder tests.

#### 10. Testing Priorities

**CRITICAL (Must Have):**
- GET collection with pagination (all 9 resource types)
- GET item (all 9 resource types)
- Resource-specific query parameters (Systems, Deployments, Observations)

**HIGH (Should Have):**
- GET collection with all query parameters
- POST/PUT/PATCH methods
- Encoding tests
- Error conditions

**MEDIUM (Nice to Have):**
- DELETE methods
- Advanced query parameter combinations
- Edge case encoding

**LOW (Optional):**
- Performance testing
- Very large result sets

#### 11. Validation Against Upstream Patterns

Compare with Section 1-2 findings:
- How does upstream test resource methods?
- What assertion patterns exist?
- What test depth is used?
- Are we aligned with upstream quality standards?

#### 12. Integration with Implementation Guide

Cross-validate with Implementation Guide resource method specifications:
- ✅ Aligned: Template matches Implementation Guide

4. Add resource-specific query parameter tests (from checklist in Section 5)
5. Add resource-specific error condition tests
6. Create 2 fixtures (collection response, item response)
7. Run tests to verify ~12-15 tests pass

**Estimated Time per Resource Type:** 1-2 hours (after template established)

#### 14. Risks and Mitigation

```markdown
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Template doesn't fit all resource types | Low | Medium | Design template flexible; allow extensions |
| Resource-specific variations missed | Medium | Medium | Thorough resource type analysis; checklist |
| Test duplication across resource types | High | Low | Shared utilities; parametrized tests where possible |
| Template becomes outdated as spec evolves | Medium | Medium | Document versioning; regular reviews |
```

### Success Criteria

✅ Universal test template defined and applicable to all 9 resource types  
✅ Resource-specific variations documented for each type  
✅ Query parameter testing checklist complete  
✅ Test depth meets "meaningful" criteria from Section 6  
✅ Fixture requirements defined  
✅ Testing estimates realistic per resource type  
✅ Application guide clear for new resource types  
✅ Validated against upstream patterns  
✅ Cross-validated with Implementation Guide  

### Validation

- Template structure proven reusable
- Resource-specific variations identified for all 9 types
- Test depth goes beyond trivial checks
- Fixture count manageable (~25 fixtures)
- Test estimates align with Section 12 (combined ~1,400-1,700 lines)
- Template is maintainable and scalable

## Cross-References

**Builds On:**
- Section 12: QueryBuilder Testing Strategy (resource methods use QueryBuilder)
- Section 8: CSAPI Specification Test Requirements (resource operation specs)
- Section 6: "Meaningful vs Trivial" Definition (test depth guidance)
- Section 1-2: Upstream resource method test patterns
- **CRUD Operations Requirements:** [docs/research/requirements/csapi-crud-operations.md](../../requirements/csapi-crud-operations.md)

**Critical For:**
- Section 14: Integration Test Workflows (uses resource methods)
- Section 15: Fixture Sourcing Strategy (resource method fixtures)
- Section 36: Test Quality Checklist (resource method test validation)

**Note:** This section provides the PATTERN/TEMPLATE. Section 12 provides the detailed implementation plan. These two sections together define complete QueryBuilder + resource method testing.

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Apply template to all 9 resource types (Phase 2, Tasks 2-10)
2. Create shared test utilities (parseAndValidateUrl from Section 12)
3. Create universal fixtures (conformance, collections)
4. Create resource-specific fixtures (2 per type, 18 total)
5. Validate template against first implementation (Systems)
6. Iterate template based on learnings

---

## Risks and Mitigation

**Risk:** Template doesn't fit all resource types equally well  
**Mitigation:** Design flexible template; document variations; allow extensions

**Risk:** Resource-specific variations not comprehensive  
**Mitigation:** Thorough analysis of all 9 resource types; checklist approach

**Risk:** Template becomes maintenance burden  
**Mitigation:** Keep template simple; focus on reusability; document clearly

**Risk:** Test duplication across resource types  
**Mitigation:** Maximize shared utilities; consider parametrized tests
