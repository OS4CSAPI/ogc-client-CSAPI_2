## 5. Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Worker Architecture Analysis ✅ (45 minutes)

**Objective:** Understand Worker implementation architecture and message types

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ Document all 9 Web Worker message types from Implementation Guide
2. ✅ Map message types to parser operations
3. ✅ Analyze Worker initialization and lifecycle
4. ✅ Identify fallback behavior requirements
5. ✅ Document Worker architecture patterns

**Findings:**
- Existing 4 message types: parseWmsCapabilities, parseWfsCapabilities, queryWfsFeatureTypeDetails, parseWmtsCapabilities
- Request/response protocol via `WorkerRequest`/`WorkerResponse` with unique requestId
- Fallback mechanism uses EventTarget for non-worker environments
- `sendTaskRequest()` returns Promise, `addTaskHandler()` registers handlers

### Phase 2: Upstream Worker Test Analysis ✅ (30 minutes)

**Objective:** Analyze existing Worker test patterns in camptocamp/ogc-client

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ Locate Worker-related tests in upstream codebase
2. ✅ Analyze Worker mocking approaches
3. ✅ Document test structure patterns
4. ✅ Identify reusable test utilities
5. ✅ Extract best practices

**Findings:**
- Existing test: `src/worker-fallback/worker-fallback.spec.ts` (WMS/WFS endpoints)
- Pattern: Use `enableFallbackWithoutWorker()` for testing without real worker
- Tests actual handler code via fallback mechanism (no worker mocking needed)
- Cache mocked to avoid persistence: `jest.mock('../shared/cache')`

### Phase 3: Jest Worker Testing Patterns ✅ (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Understand Jest capabilities for Worker testing

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ Research Jest Worker testing documentation
2. ✅ Identify Worker mocking strategies
3. ✅ Analyze async message passing test patterns
4. ✅ Document test isolation approaches
5. ✅ Identify performance testing capabilities

**Findings:**
- **Strategy 1 (Recommended):** Fallback mode testing with `enableFallbackWithoutWorker()`
- **Strategy 2:** Mock Worker `postMessage`/`addEventListener` for message passing tests
- **Strategy 3:** Real worker with worker_threads polyfill (performance testing)
- Async tests use async/await with `expect().rejects.toThrow()` for errors
- Performance tests use `performance.now()` for timing

### Phase 4: Test Scenario Design ✅ (60 minutes)

**Objective:** Design test scenarios for all Worker operations

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ Define test scenarios for each of 9 message types
2. ✅ Design async operation test patterns
3. ✅ Define fallback behavior test scenarios
4. ✅ Design performance/timeout test scenarios
5. ✅ Define error handling test scenarios
6. ✅ Document fixture requirements for heavy parsing

**Findings:**
- **Total test scenarios:** 201 (139 message type unit tests + 62 integration tests)
- **Per message type:** 10-23 scenarios (happy path, error, performance)
- **Integration tests:** Parser integration (12), fallback (9), concurrent (6), error (15), performance (20)
- **Fixture requirements:** 10 new worker-specific fixtures, leverage existing from Sections 9-11
- **Performance thresholds:** Defined per operation type and input size

### Phase 5: Synthesis ✅ (45 minutes)

**Objective:** Create comprehensive Worker testing strategy

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ Consolidate test patterns per message type
2. ✅ Create Worker test structure templates
3. ✅ Document mocking and assertion patterns
4. ✅ Estimate test implementation effort
5. ✅ Create deliverable document

**Deliverables:**
- Complete test strategy document (15 sections, ~11,000 lines)
- Test scenarios for all 9 message types (detailed specifications)
- Jest testing patterns (3 strategies with examples)
- Integration test patterns (parser, fallback, concurrent, error, performance)
- Test organization structure (13 new test files)
- Implementation estimates: 47-61 hours test implementation, 22.5-31.5 hours worker implementation

## 10. Notes and Open Questions

<!-- Add notes and unresolved questions here as research progresses -->

**Initial Observations:**
- Implementation Guide Phase 4, Task 1 mentions Worker Extensions
- 9 Web Worker message types listed in Implementation Guide
- Need to verify Jest's capabilities for Worker testing
- Worker fallback is critical for browser compatibility

**Research Findings:**
- ✅ All 9 message types cataloged with detailed specifications
- ✅ Jest fallback testing strategy validated (existing pattern works)
- ✅ Worker testing does NOT require complex mocking (use fallback mode)
- ✅ Parser integration tests can reuse fixtures from Sections 9-11
- ✅ Performance testing straightforward with `performance.now()`
- ✅ Concurrent request testing uses Promise.all() pattern

**Key Insights:**
1. **Fallback Mode is Ideal:** Testing via fallback mode is simpler and more reliable than mocking workers
2. **Fixture Reuse:** Most fixtures already exist from parser testing sections (only 10 new fixtures needed)
3. **Test Volume:** 201 test scenarios across 13 test files (~2,310-2,860 lines)
4. **Implementation Effort:** 47-61 hours for test implementation, 22.5-31.5 hours for worker code
5. **Critical Priorities:** Format parsing workers (PARSE_SENSORML_3, PARSE_SWE_RESULT, PARSE_SWE_BINARY) are highest priority

**Open Questions (Implementation Phase):**
- ❓ Should performance tests run in CI or only locally?
- ❓ What's the optimal worker pool size for concurrent requests?
- ❓ Should large fixtures (10,000 observations) be generated programmatically or committed?

**Next Steps:** ROADMAP Phase 4 - Implement worker extensions and tests per this strategy.
