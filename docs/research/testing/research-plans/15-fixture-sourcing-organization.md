## 1. Research Objective

Create comprehensive plan for sourcing, organizing, and maintaining test fixtures for all components.

**Why Fifteenth:** After defining all test requirements (Sections 8-14), identify what fixtures are needed and where to source them.

## 2. Research Questions ✅

### Core Questions - ANSWERED

1. ✅ What fixtures can be extracted from CSAPI specifications? **25+ examples from Parts 1 & 2**
2. ✅ What fixtures can be sourced from OpenSensorHub demo server? **NONE - Server unavailable (404)**
3. ✅ What fixtures need to be hand-crafted (edge cases, errors)? **~110 fixtures (GeoJSON, workflows, errors)**
4. ✅ How to organize fixtures by resource type and format? **Test-type hierarchy with resource subdirectories**
5. ✅ How to structure fixture files for reusability? **Universal fixtures, cross-format equivalence, composition**
6. ✅ How to document fixture provenance? **Embedded metadata + sidecar files + SOURCES.md**
7. ✅ How to keep fixtures in sync with spec updates? **Automated validation, quarterly review, changelog**

### Detailed Questions - ANSWERED

- ✅ What fixture formats are needed? **JSON (primary), CSV (SWE text), Binary (SWE base64)**
- ✅ How many fixture variants per resource type? **4 variants: valid (2), invalid (2) for GeoJSON; 3 encodings for SWE**
- ✅ What edge case fixtures are essential? **30 fixtures: empty, null, invalid, schema violations, HTTP errors, extreme**
- ✅ How to handle large vs small fixtures? **Size-based complexity classification: simple (15-30 min), medium (30-60 min), complex (1-3 hrs)**
- ✅ What naming conventions for fixtures? **kebab-case: `<category>-<subcategory>-<variant>.<ext>`**
- ✅ How to version fixtures alongside code? **Metadata tracking, schema pinning, changelog**
- ✅ What fixture validation is needed? **Schema (Ajv), semantic (vocabularies), integration (link integrity)**
