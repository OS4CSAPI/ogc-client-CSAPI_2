# ⚠️ PERFORMANCE TESTING IS NOT IN SCOPE ⚠️

## IMPORTANT DECISION: NO PERFORMANCE TESTING WILL BE IMPLEMENTED

**FIRM RULE:** Performance testing will **NOT** be implemented for this project.

**Rationale:**
- Upstream `ogc-client` has **ZERO** performance tests
- We are matching upstream's testing approach  
- Performance testing is out of scope
- Functional correctness is the priority

**This research was completed to understand what performance testing would require, but NONE of it will be implemented.**

---

## 1. Research Objective

Define strategy for testing performance characteristics and efficiency (especially for parsers and large datasets).

**Why 33rd:** After functional testing defined, address non-functional requirements like performance.

## 10. Notes and Open Questions

**Research Completed:** February 6, 2026

**Key Findings:**

1. **No Upstream Performance Tests**: Upstream `ogc-client` has NO performance testing infrastructure. Must design from scratch.

2. **Binary Encoding Performance Critical**: Binary SWE Common expected 2x faster than JSON, critical for high-frequency sensors (>10 Hz). Represents ~50% of parser testing effort due to complexity.

3. **Performance Targets Defined**:
   - **Parser (JSON):** 100 obs <10ms, 1000 obs <100ms, 10000 obs <1000ms (p95)
   - **Parser (Binary):** 100 obs <5ms, 1000 obs <50ms, 10000 obs <500ms (p95)
   - **Worker Overhead:** <5ms message round-trip (p95)
   - **Memory Usage:** <10MB per 1000 observations

4. **Statistical Rigor Required**: Multiple iterations (50-100), percentile reporting (p50/p95/p99), not just mean. First 10% warmup iterations discarded.

5. **Regression Detection**: 10% slowdown threshold for alerting. Baseline established from initial implementation.

6. **Large Dataset Testing**: 10, 100, 1000, 10000 observation sizes. Realistic production scale is 1000-10000 observations per request.

7. **Memory Concerns**: Large datasets (>10,000 observations) risk browser crashes. Need explicit memory usage tests with heap size tracking.

8. **CI/CD Integration**: Performance tests run nightly (not on every PR) due to environment variability. Alerting only, not blocking.

**Test Implementation Estimates:**
- **Total:** 53 tests, 2,540-3,375 lines
- **Parser Performance:** 16 tests, 520-680 lines (CRITICAL)
- **Worker Performance:** 9 tests, 320-410 lines (HIGH)
- **Memory Usage:** 8 tests, 300-380 lines (CRITICAL)
- **API Performance:** 12 tests, 360-445 lines (HIGH)
- **Pagination Performance:** 8 tests, 260-340 lines (MEDIUM)
- **Infrastructure:** 4 files, 780-1,120 lines (utilities, fixtures, reporting)

**Implementation Effort:** 46-64 hours (2-3 weeks, 1 developer)

**Priorities:**
1. **Priority 1 (CRITICAL):** Parser performance (JSON/Binary), memory usage, statistical utilities
2. **Priority 2 (HIGH):** Worker performance, API performance, baseline management
3. **Priority 3 (MEDIUM):** Complex schemas, offset pagination, profiling utilities

**Key Challenges:**
- Environment variability (browser, CPU, memory)
- Statistical significance (need 50-100 iterations)
- Large fixture generation (10,000+ observations)
- Worker message overhead (can negate parsing speedup for small datasets)
- Memory measurement (Chrome-only, requires `--expose-gc` flag)

**Performance Testing Tools:**
- **Browser Performance API:** High-resolution timing (`performance.now()`)
- **performance.mark/measure:** Custom measurement points
- **Memory API (Chrome):** Heap size tracking (`performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize`)
- **Chrome DevTools Profiler:** CPU profiling (`console.profile()`)
- **Benchmark.js (optional):** Statistical benchmark framework

**Deliverable Location:**  
[docs/research/testing/findings/33-performance-efficiency-testing.md](../findings/33-performance-efficiency-testing.md)

---

**Next Steps:** Implement Priority 1 (CRITICAL) performance tests - parser benchmarks, memory usage tests, statistical utilities.
