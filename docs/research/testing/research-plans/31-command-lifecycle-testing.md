## 7. Deliverable

**Command lifecycle testing strategy with state transition scenarios**

Content includes:
- Complete command lifecycle state diagram
- Command lifecycle states (pending, accepted, executing, completed, failed, cancelled)
- State transition rules and test patterns
- Command submission test scenarios
- Parameter validation tests (schema-based)
- Status tracking test patterns (polling)
- Result retrieval test scenarios (success and failure)
- Cancellation test scenarios (pending, executing states)
- Invalid cancellation scenarios (completed, failed states)
- Synchronous command test patterns (immediate execution)
- Asynchronous command test patterns (deferred execution)
- Status polling strategies for async commands
- Timeout and expiration test scenarios
- State machine validation tests
- Invalid state transition tests
- Fixture requirements for all lifecycle states
- Implementation estimates

**Command Lifecycle States:**
1. **Pending**: Command submitted, awaiting execution
2. **Accepted**: Command validated and queued
3. **Executing**: Command currently running
4. **Completed**: Command finished successfully
5. **Failed**: Command execution failed
6. **Cancelled**: Command cancelled before completion

**Example State Transitions:**
- Pending → Accepted → Executing → Completed (successful sync)
- Pending → Accepted → Executing → Failed (execution error)
- Pending → Cancelled (cancelled before execution)
- Executing → Cancelled (cancelled during execution)

## 10. Notes and Open Questions

<!-- Add notes and unresolved questions here as research progresses -->

**Initial Observations:**
- Commands are unique to CSAPI Part 2 (control operations)
- Command lifecycle has clear states and transitions
- Synchronous vs asynchronous execution significantly affects testing
- Cancellation is time-sensitive (can only cancel pending/executing)

**Command Lifecycle Endpoints:**
- `POST /controlstreams/{id}/commands` - Submit command
- `GET /commands/{id}` - Get command status
- `GET /commands/{id}/result` - Get command result (when completed)
- `DELETE /commands/{id}` - Cancel command

**Synchronous vs Asynchronous:**
- **Synchronous**: Command executes immediately, result returned in response (HTTP 200)
- **Asynchronous**: Command queued, status tracked via polling (HTTP 201 + Location header)
- Sync/async determined by server capability or command type

**State Transition Validation:**
- **Valid**: Pending → Accepted → Executing → Completed
- **Valid**: Pending → Accepted → Executing → Failed
- **Valid**: Pending → Cancelled (before execution)
- **Valid**: Executing → Cancelled (during execution)
- **Invalid**: Completed → Cancelled (cannot cancel completed)
- **Invalid**: Failed → Executing (cannot resume failed)

**Polling Strategy (Async):**
- Initial poll: Immediately after submission
- Subsequent polls: Increasing intervals (exponential backoff?)
- Stop polling: When state is terminal (completed, failed, cancelled)

---

**Next Steps:** Review CSAPI Part 2 specification for command lifecycle state definitions and transition rules.
