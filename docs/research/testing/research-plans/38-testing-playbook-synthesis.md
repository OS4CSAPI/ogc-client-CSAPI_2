## 10. Notes and Open Questions

<!-- Add notes and unresolved questions here as research progresses -->

**Initial Observations:**
- This is the culmination of all research
- Must be practical and actionable, not theoretical
- Developers should be able to start testing immediately
- Examples are critical for understanding

**Playbook Purpose:**
Transform comprehensive research into step-by-step implementation guide that developers can follow during Phase 1-4 implementation.

**Key Success Criteria:**
- Developer can read Phase 1 section and start writing tests immediately
- Clear answer to "what do I do next?"
- Examples demonstrate every major pattern
- Quality validation ensures tests meet standards
- Progress tracking shows when component is done

**Synthesis Approach:**
1. Extract workflows from all research sections
2. Organize by implementation phase (1-4)
3. Provide step-by-step instructions
4. Include concrete examples
5. Add validation checkpoints
6. Document tools and commands

**Example Format:**
- **Goal**: What you're trying to accomplish
- **Steps**: 1, 2, 3... concrete actions
- **Code**: Complete working example
- **Validation**: How to verify it works
- **Checklist**: Quality validation items

**Playbook vs Research Plans:**
- **Research Plans**: WHY, WHAT (requirements, specifications)
- **Playbook**: HOW (step-by-step implementation)
- Research answers "what should tests cover?"
- Playbook answers "how do I write those tests?"

**Phase 1 Workflow Detail (Example):**
- Task 1.1: Type System (4-5 hours)
  - 7 steps: Create types → Write tests → Add Part 2 types → Write tests → Add query options → Write tests → Validate
  - Expected output: ~350-400 lines model.ts, ~200-300 lines model.spec.ts
  - Validation: 8 tests passing, coverage >85%
- Task 1.2: Helper Utilities (3-4 hours)
  - 7 steps: Create helpers → Write tests → Add query string builder → Write tests → Add temporal parsing → Write tests → Validate
  - Expected output: ~50-80 lines helpers.ts, ~150-200 lines helpers.spec.ts
  - Validation: 12 tests passing, coverage >90%
- Task 1.3: Stub QueryBuilder (2-3 hours)
- Task 1.4: OgcApiEndpoint Integration (3-4 hours)

**Component Patterns Provided:**
- **QueryBuilder Pattern:** URL validation + parameter encoding + resource availability (standard test structure)
- **Parser Pattern:** Structure validation + type inference + nested parsing + error handling
- **Integration Pattern:** End-to-end workflow + fixture-driven + multi-step validation
- **Utilities Pattern:** Pure functions + comprehensive edge cases + performance validation
- **Worker Pattern:** Message handling + async operations + error propagation

**3 Complete Examples:**
1. **First QueryBuilder Test:** Complete walkthrough from setup to running test (getSystems method)
2. **First Parser Test:** Fixture creation → parser implementation → test creation → validation (DataRecord)
3. **First Integration Test:** Multi-step discovery workflow (endpoint → collection → systems → datastreams)

**Quality Validation:**
- Pre-commit checklist (23 items across 5 categories)
- Common quality issues and fixes (4 detailed examples)
- Bug detection validation process
- Coverage target validation

**Progress Tracking:**
- Component completion criteria (3 components defined)
- Phase completion checklists (4 phases)
- Coverage targets by component (Statement 90-95%, Branch 85-90%, Function 88-100%)
- Progress dashboard template

**Key Success Factors:**
- **Immediate Action:** Developer can start Phase 1, Task 1.1 immediately after reading
- **Clear Steps:** Every task has 5-7 concrete steps with time estimates
- **Examples:** 3 complete working examples to copy/adapt
- **Validation:** Quality checklist ensures tests meet standards
- **Reference:** All 37 research sections synthesized and linked

**Testing Principles Reinforced:**
- **Meaningful:** Validate real behavior, not mocks (use parseAndValidateUrl)
- **Useful:** Catch real bugs (validate by breaking code)
- **Deep:** Comprehensive coverage (>85% statement, >80% branch, all edge cases)
- **End-to-End:** Complete workflows (3+ operations, real fixtures)

**What This Unblocks:**
- ✅ Phase 1 implementation can begin immediately
- ✅ Clear answer to "what do I do next?" at every step
- ✅ Pattern consistency across all components
- ✅ Quality assurance through checklist
- ✅ Progress measurement through completion criteria
