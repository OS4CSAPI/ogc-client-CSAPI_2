# Section 19: Test Organization and File Structure - Research Plan

**Status:** Research Planning Phase - Outline Only  
**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026  
**Estimated Research Time:** TBD

---

## 1. Research Objective

Define complete test file structure, naming conventions, and organization strategy.

**Why Nineteenth:** After all test content defined, organize it into coherent file structure matching upstream patterns.

---

## 2. Research Questions

### Core Questions

1. What test files are needed? (names and purposes)
2. How to organize tests by component vs resource type?
3. Where to locate test files (colocated vs separate test/ directory)?
4. How to name test files consistently with upstream?
5. How to structure describe/it blocks?
6. How to organize test utilities and helpers?
7. How to organize fixtures?

### Detailed Questions

- What test file naming conventions does upstream use?
- How are test files organized in upstream directory structure?
- What test utilities are shared vs component-specific?
- How to organize fixtures for easy discovery and reuse?
- What test file structure makes tests maintainable?
- How to organize integration vs unit tests?
- What test metadata/documentation is needed per file?
- How to organize test configuration files?

## 3. Primary Resources

- **File Organization Strategy**: [docs/upstream/file-organization-analysis.md](../../upstream/file-organization-analysis.md)
- **Implementation Guide**: [docs/planning/csapi-implementation-guide.md](../../../planning/csapi-implementation-guide.md) (Test file specifications)

## 4. Supporting Resources

- Section 1 deliverable (upstream test file patterns)
- Section 2 deliverable (test organization across implementations)
- Section 15 deliverable (fixture organization)
- All component testing section deliverables (8-18) for test file requirements

## 5. Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Upstream Test Structure Analysis (TBD minutes)

**Objective:** Analyze test file organization in upstream codebase

**Tasks:**
1. Map upstream test file structure
2. Analyze test file naming conventions
3. Document describe/it block organization patterns
4. Analyze test utility organization
5. Extract test structure best practices

### Phase 2: Test File Inventory (TBD minutes)

**Objective:** Create complete inventory of needed test files

**Tasks:**
1. Compile test file requirements from all component sections
2. Categorize test files by type (unit, integration, e2e)
3. Identify shared utilities and helpers needed
4. Document test file purpose and scope per file
5. Create test file inventory matrix

### Phase 3: Directory Structure Design (TBD minutes)

**Objective:** Design test directory structure

**Tasks:**
1. Design root test directory structure
2. Design component test subdirectories
3. Design fixture directory structure (integrate Section 15 deliverable)
4. Design test utility directory structure
5. Document directory structure specification

### Phase 4: Naming Convention Definition (TBD minutes)

**Objective:** Define test file and directory naming conventions

**Tasks:**
1. Define test file naming patterns
2. Define fixture file naming patterns
3. Define test utility naming patterns
4. Define describe/it block naming conventions
5. Document naming convention specification

### Phase 5: Test Structure Templates (TBD minutes)

**Objective:** Create reusable test file templates

**Tasks:**
1. Create unit test file template
2. Create integration test file template
3. Create parser test file template
4. Create QueryBuilder test file template
5. Create resource method test file template
6. Document test structure templates

### Phase 6: Synthesis (TBD minutes)

**Objective:** Create comprehensive test organization specification

**Tasks:**
1. Consolidate directory structure design
2. Finalize naming conventions
3. Document test file templates
4. Create test organization guidelines
5. Create deliverable document

## 6. Success Criteria

This research is complete when:

- [ ] Complete test file inventory exists
- [ ] Directory structure is designed and validated
- [ ] Naming conventions are documented
- [ ] Test structure templates are created
- [ ] Test organization matches upstream patterns
- [ ] Fixture organization is integrated
- [ ] Deliverable document is peer-reviewed

---

## 7. Deliverable

**Complete test file structure specification with naming conventions**

Content includes:
- Test file inventory (names, purposes, scopes)
- Directory structure specification
- Test file naming conventions
- Fixture directory structure (from Section 15)
- Test utility organization
- Describe/it block naming conventions
- Test file templates by type
- Test organization guidelines
- Cross-reference map (tests to source files)

---

## 8. Dependencies

**Must Complete Before Starting:**
- Section 1: Upstream Blueprint Analysis (test file patterns)
- Section 2: Existing Upstream Test Pattern Survey (organization patterns)
- Section 15: Fixture Sourcing and Organization Strategy (fixture structure)
- All component testing sections (8-18) for test file requirements

**Blocks:**
- All test implementation (structure must exist before tests are written)
- Jest configuration (test file patterns needed)

---

## 9. Research Status Checklist

## 10. Notes and Open Questions

<!-- Add notes and unresolved questions here as research progresses -->

**Initial Observations:**
- File Organization Strategy analysis exists in upstream folder
- Test files likely follow .spec.ts or .test.ts naming
- May use colocated tests (near source) or separate test/ directory
- Need to ensure structure is maintainable as codebase grows

---

**Next Steps:** Review File Organization Strategy analysis to understand upstream test file patterns.
