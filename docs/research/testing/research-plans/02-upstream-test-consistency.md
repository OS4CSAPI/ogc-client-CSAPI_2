# Section 02: Existing Upstream Test Pattern Survey - Research Plan

**Status:** Research Planning Phase - Not Started  
**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026  
**Estimated Research Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Estimated Test Implementation Lines:** N/A (Research produces analysis document, not tests)

---

## 1. Research Objective

Survey and document consistent testing patterns across all existing ogc-client implementations (WFS, WMS, WMTS, STAC, EDR). Identify library-wide conventions, test-to-code ratios, shared utilities, and quality standards that define the expected testing approach for any new OGC API implementation.

**Why 2nd:** After understanding EDR (Section 1) - the newest and closest match to CSAPI - we need to validate those patterns are consistent across the entire library. This identifies:
- **Library-wide conventions** that all implementations follow
- **Mature patterns** from older implementations (WFS, WMS, WMTS)
- **Evolution** of testing practices over time
- **Shared infrastructure** we should leverage
- **Gaps** where EDR differs from established patterns

## 10. Notes and Open Questions

<!-- Add notes and unresolved questions here as research progresses -->

**Initial Observations:**
- Survey covers 5 implementations (WFS, WMS, WMTS, STAC, EDR) spanning multiple years
- Older implementations (WFS, WMS) may have outdated patterns
- Recent implementations (STAC, EDR) likely reflect current best practices
- Need to identify library evolution trajectory

**Risks and Mitigation:**

**Risk:** Older implementations (WFS, WMS) may have outdated test patterns  
**Mitigation:** Weight recent implementations (STAC, EDR) more heavily in recommendations; document evolution trajectory clearly

**Risk:** Different implementations may have different complexity requiring different patterns  
**Mitigation:** Normalize comparisons by complexity; identify and document complexity-driven variations

**Risk:** Coverage metrics may not be consistently available across all implementations  
**Mitigation:** Use current coverage tools to measure retrospectively; estimate if needed; focus on pattern presence/absence

**Risk:** Time-consuming to analyze 5+ implementations deeply  
**Mitigation:** Focus on pattern presence/absence rather than deep analysis of each; sample 2-3 representative tests per implementation for depth analysis

**Validation Against Section 1:**
- Section 1 provided detailed EDR blueprint
- This section validates EDR patterns are consistent with library standards
- Any EDR deviations from library patterns should be documented and explained
- If EDR introduces new patterns not in older implementations, document as emerging patterns

**Next Steps After Completion:**
1. Compare consistency matrix findings with Section 1 EDR blueprint
2. Validate universal patterns are present in EDR
3. Identify and explain any EDR deviations from standard patterns
4. Use consistency matrix to guide all subsequent test design decisions
5. Update Section 3 research with library-specific context
