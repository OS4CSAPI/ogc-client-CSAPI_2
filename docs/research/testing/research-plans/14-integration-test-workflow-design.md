# Section 14: Integration Test Workflow Design - Research Plan

**Status:** Research Planning Phase - Outline Only  
**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026  
**Estimated Research Time:** TBD  
**Estimated Test Implementation Lines:** TBD

---

## 1. Research Objective

Design the 4 integration test workflows defined in Implementation Guide with concrete test scenarios.

**Why Fourteenth:** After unit-level testing patterns (Sections 12-13), design multi-component workflows that test interactions.

---

## 2. Research Questions

### Core Questions

1. How to structure Discovery workflow tests?
2. How to structure Observation workflow tests?
3. How to structure Command workflow tests?
4. How to structure Cross-resource navigation tests?
5. What mocking strategy for HTTP responses?
6. What fixtures needed for multi-step workflows?
7. How to validate state changes across workflow steps?

### Detailed Questions

- What components interact in each workflow?
- How to test workflow state transitions?
- What assertions validate workflow completion?
- How to test partial workflow failures?
- What test isolation strategies are needed?
- How to structure multi-step test scenarios?
- What makes a workflow test "meaningful" vs "trivial"?

5. Document mocking patterns per workflow type

### Phase 4: Validation Design (TBD minutes)

**Objective:** Define assertions and validation for workflow tests

**Tasks:**
1. Define Discovery workflow assertions
2. Define Observation workflow assertions
