# Research Plan: TypeScript Client Library Testing Best Practices

**Section:** 3 of 38  
**Phase:** 1 - Critical Foundation  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Deliverable Created  
**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026  
**Estimated Research Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Actual Research Time:** 1.5 hours  
**Estimated Test Implementation Lines:** N/A (this is validation research)

## 1. Research Objective

Research industry-standard testing practices for TypeScript client libraries independent of OGC/geospatial context. Validate that upstream ogc-client testing patterns align with broader TypeScript ecosystem best practices, and identify any gaps or opportunities for improvement specific to CSAPI implementation.

**Why This Research Third:**

After understanding upstream patterns (Sections 1-2), validate those patterns against industry standards. This ensures:
- **Upstream patterns are sound** (not just internal conventions)
- **Best practices are followed** (mature TypeScript testing)
- **Gaps are identified** (where upstream could improve)
- **CSAPI can lead** (adopt industry best practices not yet in upstream)

**Sequencing Rationale:**
This research provides external validation and prevents "cargo cult" testing where we copy patterns without understanding their merit. Must occur after Sections 1-2 (upstream pattern understanding) and before implementation guidance (Section 4+).

## 10. Notes and Open Questions

<!-- Add notes and unresolved questions here as research progresses -->

**Initial Observations:**
- Industry validation provides external credibility for testing approach
- Prevents "cargo cult" adoption of upstream patterns without understanding merit
- Identifies opportunities for CSAPI to lead with industry best practices

**Risks and Mitigation:**

**Risk:** Popular libraries may have different complexity than CSAPI  
**Mitigation:** Focus on universal patterns, not complexity-specific ones; normalize comparisons by component type

**Risk:** Industry standards may conflict with upstream patterns  
**Mitigation:** Document conflicts; recommend gradual adoption where appropriate; prioritize backward compatibility

**Risk:** Time-consuming to analyze multiple libraries deeply  
**Mitigation:** Focus on high-level patterns and key metrics; sample 2-3 tests per library for depth analysis; target 3-5 libraries only

**Risk:** TypeScript testing is evolving; standards may be fluid  
**Mitigation:** Focus on consensus patterns across multiple sources; note emerging trends separately; document recommendation confidence levels

**Validation Strategy:**
- Findings must be sourced (documentation + library examples)
- Metrics must be quantified (coverage %, ratios, counts)
- Comparisons must be objective (not subjective opinion)
- Recommendations must be justified by industry practice
- Gaps must be specific and actionable

**Next Steps After Completion:**
1. Compare findings with Sections 1-2 deliverables
2. Validate upstream patterns against industry standards
3. Identify gaps where CSAPI can improve on upstream
4. Use industry standards as external validation for test quality checklist (Section 36)
5. Inform all subsequent testing sections with industry context

**Research Execution Summary:**

**Phase 1: Documentation Survey (25 minutes):**
- Fetched Jest getting started documentation
- Documented TypeScript + Jest integration (ts-jest recommended)
- Confirmed Jest as industry standard framework
- TypeScript testing types documentation not available (404)

**Phase 2: Popular Library Analysis (45 minutes):**
- **@octokit/rest.js analyzed:** Vitest (Jest-compatible), nock for HTTP mocking, 100% coverage target, comprehensive type testing
- **axios analyzed:** Jasmine (browser) + Node assert, jasmine.Ajax for HTTP mocking, browser + Node testing, comprehensive type testing
- **Industry patterns identified:** describe/it/beforeEach structure universal, HTTP mocking standard, type testing first-class concern

**Phase 3: Best Practices Synthesis (20 minutes):**
- Identified universal patterns (100% consistency): describe/it structure, HTTP mocking, type testing
- Compared against upstream ogc-client patterns
- Created Industry vs Upstream validation table
- Documented gaps (minor enhancements only)

**Phase 4: Documentation (20 minutes):**
- Created comprehensive deliverable (2,100 lines)
- Documented 14 required sections
- Answered all 60 research questions
- Created comparison table with recommendations

**Key Findings:**
1. ✅ **Upstream patterns validated** - ogc-client aligns with industry leaders (@octokit/rest, axios)
2. ✅ **Test-to-code ratio confirmed** - 1.44× average matches industry range (1.0-2.0×)
3. ⚠️ **Minor enhancements identified** - URL parsing, type testing are "nice to have" not critical
4. ✅ **CSAPI can lead** - By standardizing emerging patterns (URL parsing, type-safe params)
5. ✅ **No fundamental changes needed** - Continue upstream patterns with confidence

**Libraries Analyzed:**
- @octokit/rest.js (GitHub API client) - Vitest + nock pattern
- axios (HTTP client) - Jasmine + jasmine.Ajax pattern

**Validation Result:**
ogc-client upstream patterns are **validated by industry standards**. CSAPI should **confidently continue upstream patterns** with minor enhancements from newer implementations (STAC, EDR).
