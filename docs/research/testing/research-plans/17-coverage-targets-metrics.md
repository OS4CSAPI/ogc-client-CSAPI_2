# Section 17: Coverage Targets and Metrics Definition - Research Plan

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Last Updated:** January 8, 2025  
**Actual Research Time:** ~90 minutes

---

## 1. Research Objective

Define specific coverage targets for each component type and how to measure meaningful coverage (not just %).

**Why Seventeenth:** After defining all test types, set concrete coverage targets validated against upstream standards.

---

## 2. Research Questions

### Core Questions

1. What overall coverage % is required?
2. What coverage targets per component type (QueryBuilder, parsers, types)?
3. How to measure branch coverage vs statement coverage?
4. What's acceptable for type definition coverage?
5. How to measure "meaningful" coverage vs just % coverage?
6. What modules require 95%+ coverage vs 80%?
7. How to track coverage by phase during incremental development?

### Detailed Questions

- What coverage metrics does upstream use?
- What coverage tools are in use (Jest coverage, c8, nyc)?
- How to set coverage thresholds in Jest config?
- What code should be excluded from coverage?
- How to measure untested edge cases vs untested code?
- What's the relationship between coverage % and test quality?
- How to report coverage meaningfully?
- What coverage regression checks are needed?

**Objective:** Define how to configure and track coverage

**Tasks:**
1. Design Jest coverage configuration
2. Define coverage threshold enforcement
3. Design incremental coverage tracking per phase
4. Define coverage reporting strategy
5. Create coverage monitoring procedures

### Phase 6: Synthesis (TBD minutes)

**Objective:** Create comprehensive coverage specification

**Tasks:**
1. Consolidate coverage targets by component
2. Create Jest configuration templates
3. Document coverage validation procedures
4. Create deliverable document

## 10. Research Results Summary

**Completion Date:** January 8, 2025

**Key Findings:**

1. **Upstream State:**
   - No coverage thresholds currently configured in jest.config.cjs
   - Only XML files excluded from coverage
   - No coverage scripts in package.json
   - Comprehensive testing exists but coverage not measured

2. **Official Requirements:**
   - >80% statement coverage (official CSAPI requirement)
   - >80% branch coverage (official CSAPI requirement)
   - 100% public API coverage (all exports)
   - ~4,500-6,000 test lines expected

3. **Component-Specific Targets Defined:**
   - QueryBuilders: 90-95% statement, 85-90% branch
   - Parsers (SensorML, SWE): 90-95% statement, 85-95% branch
   - Endpoint: 90-95% statement, 85-90% branch
   - Utilities: 85-95% statement, 80-90% branch
   - Workers: 85-90% statement, 80-85% branch
   - Error Classes: 90-100% statement, 80-90% branch

4. **Meaningful Coverage Metrics:**
   - Edge case coverage (boundary conditions, extreme values)
   - Error path coverage (all error types tested)
   - Assertion quality (specific vs trivial assertions)
   - Behavior-driven coverage (requirements → tests)

5. **Implementation Strategy:**
   - Jest configuration with `coverageThreshold` per component
   - Coverage scripts in package.json
   - Incremental targets per ROADMAP phase (50% → 70% → 80% → 88%)
   - Coverage regression prevention (git hooks, CI checks)
   - Coverage monitoring (Codecov/Coveralls integration)

**Deliverable:** [17-coverage-targets-and-metrics.md](../findings/17-coverage-targets-and-metrics.md)

**Impact:**
- Provides ready-to-use Jest coverage configuration
- Defines clear quality metrics beyond percentages
- Establishes incremental path to >80% coverage
- Enables coverage enforcement in CI/CD

**Research Complete.** Ready for Jest configuration implementation (Phase 4 immediate actions).
